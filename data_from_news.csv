Milei was accompanied by the Chancellor, Diana Mondino, the Minister of Defense, Luis Petri, the Minister of the Interior, Guillermo Francos, and the Secretary General of the Presidency, Karina Milei. The president and his entourage spent Friday night in Río Gallegos, in the southern tip of Patagonia, before embarking on a three and a half hour flight this Saturday to Antarctica, where the country has 13 scientific research bases. .

Minutes before taking the flight, Mondino took a photo next to the Hercules plane, on whose front nose stands out an image of the Malvinas Islands, whose sovereignty Argentina claims from the United Kingdom.

In the years in which he became popular in explosive appearances on television shows and on social networks, Milei never showed affinity with the issue of climate change, which he even relativized from his well-known ultraliberal positions. “All those policies that blame humans for climate change are false,” Milei said in October 2023, on the occasion of the second presidential debate.

But Grossi, who spent the end of the year festivities in Buenos Aires, convinced the Argentine head of state to travel to Antarctica, something that the previous president, Alberto Fernández, had already done in February 2023, the first visit by a Argentine president in a quarter of a century.

Grossi, who is serving his second term as director general of the IAEA, is identified as one of the potential successors of the Portuguese António Guterres in the general secretariat of the United Nations (UN). Guterres recently visited Antarctica in the company of Chilean President Gabriel Boric.

Gabriel Amorth)

By now, many of us have heard about the apparent lightning strike in Argentina on December 17, 2023, Francis’s birthday. According to reports, lightning struck the statue of St. Peter at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolás, destroying St. Peter’s key (one key was apparently already missing) and the hand that held it. Surely, some say, this is a sign from God that Francis has either lost the papacy or never had it.

As fascinating as this possible sign is, Francis has given us many reasons far more persuasive than this to question the legitimacy of his claims to the papacy. One could, for example, argue that the document Francis released the day after the apparent lightning strike — Fiducia Supplicans, which “authorizes” the blessing of same-sex unions — is a greater indication that he is an anti-pope. And, for those who have understood the theology behind the Synod on Synodality, that ongoing process makes Fiducia Supplicans look relatively Catholic in comparison.

Even though Francis’s “latest heresies” may be no more heretical than many others he has promoted (most of which have their roots in the Vatican II revolution) there is something noteworthy, and perhaps theologically significant, about the reality that more people are noticing Francis’s heresies and wickedness.

So if the lightning strike is a message from God . . . why now? Whether or not we trust the reports of the lightning strike, it does appear that we have seen evidence of the progressive manifestation of Satan’s influence over Francis and his collaborators. Thus, even though Francis’s “latest heresies” may be no more heretical than many others he has promoted (most of which have their roots in the Vatican II revolution) there is something noteworthy, and perhaps theologically significant, about the reality that more people are noticing Francis’s heresies and wickedness.

In connection with this progressive manifestation, one frame of reference for us to consider comes from St. Robert Bellarmine’s famous “fifth opinion” about the possibility of a heretical pope. St. Robert Bellarmine favored the opinion that God would never permit a pope to fall into heresy; but in the event that God permitted a pope to fall into heresy, he considered the following opinion (the fifth he considered) to be correct:

“Now the fifth true opinion, is that a pope who is a manifest heretic, ceases in himself to be pope and head, just as he ceases in himself to be a Christian and member of the body of the Church; whereby he can be judged and punished by the Church.”

As we know, not all Traditional Catholic theologians agree with this position — some, like Cardinal Raymond Burke, have adopted similar positions, but others have not. For purposes of considering the significance of the “progressive manifestation” of Francis’s heresies, though, it is worth examining certain points from an analysis of St. Robert Bellarmine’s fifth opinion by Arnaldo Xavier da Silveira, found in his study entitled Two Timely Issues: The New Mass and the Possibility of a Heretical Pope.

One of the real tragedies of the Vatican II revolution is the reality that most people identifying as Catholics would have been deemed heretics by pre-Vatican II (read “Catholic”) standards.

Xavier da Silveira considered St. Robert Bellarmine’s fifth opinion to be correct, but he saw that it left open certain essential prudential considerations:

“Having established the speculative principles on the theological hypothesis of a heretical pope, imposed with the adoption of the fifth opinion enumerated by Saint Robert Bellarmine, we now move onto prudential ground. Now one can ask, what is the result of all this? Is it not true that an eventual heretical pope will remain in office whether one adopts the opinion of Cajetan, Saint Robert, Suarez, or any other important theologian, and even if the whole rigorous procedure is followed, with admonitions and everything else? Can any of the opinions concretely solve the crisis? Is it not a vain effort, a mere empty academicism, to deal with this matter?” (p. 228)

Here Xavier da Silveira identifies a source of endless debate between those who believe the matter is “solved” once they declare a man to be an anti-pope and those who see no practical point to the exercise if it does not ultimately remove and replace the heretic. We can see this division even among those who believe John XXIII and his ostensible successors were not popes: a large portion of those who insist that Francis is not pope are content to believe that there have been no popes since Pius XII; whereas another portion of those who rejected John XXIII have seen the problem of not having a pope and have attempted to elect their own.

Crucially, none of these maneuvers to address the sedevacantist belief that John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, and Benedict XVI were anti-popes were adequate to prevent Bergoglio from convincing the world that he is Pope Francis. Something more is required, which Xavier da Silveira tied to a “supernatural spirit” which must animate those trying to react to a heretical pope”

“Because of these questions, it is not enough to say that the controversy will produce procedures and surprises about which little can be said in theory. It is not enough to try and predict maneuvers and strategies or set tactical guidelines to deal with a slippery and unpredictable reality. The real answer to these questions is to face the situation with a supernatural spirit so that the thick of battle does not cause those fighting the good fight to panic, but rather to always bear in mind this profound meaning of things.” (p. 228)

Even if we were to dismiss everything else Xavier da Silveira wrote, we can appreciate the wisdom of this conclusion that the answer to many questions surrounding a heretical pope is to “face the situation with a supernatural spirit.” How could it be otherwise if we know that God is permitting this horrific situation and will be the One Who solves it?

Today, for example, we have well-meaning Catholics trying to “solve” the Francis problem who see no issue with the fact that Francis’s predecessors have been promoting the heresy of false ecumenism since the Council. This is itself a problem.

Xavier da Silveira saw that the sensus fidei was key to this supernatural spirit in defense of the Church against a heretical pope:

“In defense of the Faith or of a specific point of Catholic doctrine, convergence in the tendencies of the combatants must be born with a supernatural principle, i.e., grace. Thus, it is not only a matter of uniting souls in a certain direction but of nourishing their faith. A Catholic movement in defense of the Faith will only have life and strength if it springs from the depth of souls inspired by the sensus fidei, which differs radically from natural tendencies. The sensus fidei is like a spiritual sense, which sees, appreciates, and judges all things in the light of the Faith. It is, as it were, the sensibility of a soul vivified by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, infused virtues, actual graces — that make present and lively the truths revealed by Our Lord — and wisdom, the savory science of the Faith.” (pp. 231-232)

We cannot possibly combat Satan and the work he is doing in Rome if we rely on our natural tendencies. We must instead fight like saints if we hope to prevail:

“If the Catholic people have a healthier, sounder part (sana pars), orthodox, fervent, and willing to fight for the Faith, the clamor of the faithful against heresy will rise vigorously even in the face of authorities.” (p. 231)

Many opponents of Francis today appear to have the requisite fervor, but we must seriously consider the collective orthodoxy of those who see Bergoglio as an imposter. One of the real tragedies of the Vatican II revolution is the reality that most people identifying as Catholics would have been deemed heretics by pre-Vatican II (read “Catholic”) standards. Today, for example, we have well-meaning Catholics trying to “solve” the Francis problem who see no issue with the fact that Francis’s predecessors have been promoting the heresy of false ecumenism since the Council. This is itself a problem.

A worsening of the crisis, which will ultimately convince Catholics to accept the reality that we have seen not only a progressive manifestation of Francis’s heresies but also a progressive manifestation of Vatican II’s.

Accordingly, those who have promoted the concept of “living tradition” — the heresy that immutable truth can evolve over time to become something that contradicts what it once was — have effectively undermined the development of this requisite supernatural movement described by Xavier da Silveira. That is why it is absolutely vital to reject not only the horrendous fruits we see (e.g., Francis) but also the entire bad tree that was planted by Vatican II. Until this is accomplished on a much wider scale, it is difficult to imagine a situation in which faithful Catholics can truly overcome Francis and whichever heretic the next conclave would presumably produce.

What happens in the meantime? Xavier da Silveira foresaw an inevitable clash, similar to what we see today:

“Saint Robert Bellarmine teaches that the heretical pope loses his papacy when his heresy becomes manifest. This is to be understood as a full manifestation, that is, one that imposes itself to acceptance by the sana pars of Catholics. If a block of Catholics considers the manifestation doubtful or insufficient, it is either because it is not full or the block’s members are not the true sana pars. A clash will become inevitable, with everything depending on the sensus fidei of Catholics and the movements of grace. For as long as he is tolerated and accepted by the universal Church, the heretic will be a true pope, and, in principle, his acts are valid.” (p. 234)

Why would God permit such a situation? We cannot know with certainty (absent inspiration from God) but it seems that God is allowing us to have such a terrible experience with the bad fruits of Vatican II so that we can finally reject the tree itself, which was formed by grafting anti-Catholic ideas onto the tree of the immutable Catholic Faith, as Cardinal Ratzinger once told us:

“The problem of the 1960s was to acquire the better of the values drawn from two centuries of ‘liberal’ culture. There are in fact some values which, although born outside the Church, can find their place purified and corrected in its vision of the world. This is what has been done.” (quoted in the January 1997 SiSiNoNo)

As the future Benedict XVI expressed, this grafting of anti-Catholic ideas onto the tree of Catholicism was what was done; and now it must be undone. Until that happens, we should absolutely expect a worsening of the crisis, which will ultimately convince Catholics to accept the reality that we have seen not only a progressive manifestation of Francis’s heresies but also a progressive manifestation of Vatican II’s.

Our supernatural approach to solving the crisis must involve all of the things we know we should be doing anyway: prayer, penance, breaking all attachments to venial sin, and resisting all errors contrary to the unadulterated Catholic Faith.

As a final consideration, Xavier da Silveira saw that the automatic loss of the papacy still required a legal declaration from the Church:

“The loss of the papacy, therefore, will not result from a deposition by anyone but from an act of the pope himself, who, by becoming a formal and notorious heretic, will have excluded himself from the visible Church, thus tacitly resigning the papacy. The Apostolic See being vacant, an ecclesiastical body such as the College of Cardinals or the imperfect Council can legally declare the loss of office by the heretic who was pope to render the fact official and make it unequivocally known by all. The Church may then proceed to the election of a new pope.” (p. 234)

Without such a legal declaration, we would be left with chaos and, in all likelihood, no pope. So we need some official act of the Church and, until we have it, our supernatural approach to solving the crisis must involve all of the things we know we should be doing anyway: prayer, penance, breaking all attachments to venial sin, and resisting all errors contrary to the unadulterated Catholic Faith.

Regarding the possibility of an imperfect Council, it seems reasonable and prudent for those Cardinals and bishops who still have the Faith to at least explore the possibility of gathering to prayerfully discern God’s will, with a determined desire to carry out God’s will, whether or not it means removing Francis and electing another pope. For better or worse, Francis has given us some relatively simple tests to discern which Cardinals and bishops still have the Faith: those who support the Synodal Church, Traditionis Custodes, and Fiducia Supplicans do not have the Faith and cannot be part of a solution to the Church’s crisis unless they renounce their errors and convert to Catholicism.

For the remaining shepherds: trust God and become saints. If you do this, you run no risk of a misstep by trying to more actively address the crisis because you will never do anything that God has not inspired you to do. And if you tell us, your flocks, to pray and perform penance for your intentions in this regard, we will do so willingly, rejoicing to finally have shepherds to follow again.

A heated transatlantic maritime dispute is being renewed.

On Wednesday, the administration of Argentine President Javier Milei issued a statement reasserting its claim to the Falkland Islands and calling on the United Kingdom, which claims the islands as its overseas territory, to reopen bilateral negotiations.

The Argentine government stressed that it wishes for control of the islands to be passed to Buenos Aires by diplomatic means, calling diplomacy — not war — “the only possible way to restore the exercise of [Argentina’s] rights.”

The official statement by Argentina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reads:

The government and people of Argentina once again reaffirm, 191 years after the illegal occupation of the Malvinas Islands, their lawful and indefeasible sovereignty rights over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands and their adjacent maritime areas. Within this framework, the Argentine Government wishes to maintain a mature relationship with the United Kingdom that involves substantive and constructive dialogue on all matters of mutual interest with a view to building a climate of trust conducive to the resumption of negotiations.

As a candidate on the campaign trail, Milei repeatedly asserted his dedication to the cause of taking the Falkland Islands, known in his country as Las Islas Malvinas, for Argentina — a standard rallying cry for politicians across the political spectrum in that country.

Argentina argues that the islands rightfully belong to them, and that the U.K.’s claims to them are illegal. However, Argentina’s claims to the Falklands, while shrouded in verbiage of history, are primarily based around geography: Argentina claims the islands are rightfully theirs because they lay off the Argentine coast (albeit approximately 300 miles off the Argentine coast).

The Falklands did not have an indigenous population prior to European colonization. The first European to see the islands was English explorer John Davis in 1592. After that, the French became the first Europeans to build a settlement there, in 1764, but they abandoned it three years later in 1767. The English formed their own settlement on the Falkland Islands in 1765, only one year after the French.

In 1833, a permanent British settlement was established. The islands have been populated by English-speaking descendants of British settlers ever since.

Despite never settling or exercising governance over the Falkland Islands, Argentina has perpetually claimed them throughout its history, leading to the ruling military junta of the day organizing an invasion of the islands in 1982, resulting in the 74-day Falklands War, which resulted in 649 Argentine casualties, 255 British casualties, and the deaths of three Falklanders. The British won the war, recapturing the islands and obliging Argentina to surrender.

In 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum to determine whether the people there wished to remain a British Overseas Territory. The vote in favor of remaining under British rule was overwhelming, with 99.8 percent of voters choosing to maintain the status quo. In the dispute, the British have culture and tradition on their side: Falklanders are ethnically British and speak English.

In spite of the setbacks, Argentina continues to insist the Falklands belong to it, and the issue is a major rallying point in the South American country. Argentine politicians know they can inspire patriotic sentiment by talking about the Falklands War and promising to bring the islands under Argentina’s control.

What’s behind the renewed push for a dispute that has seemingly been all but settled?

Whether Milei believes in the legitimacy of Argentina’s claims or not (and he may well, considering the fact that Argentina’s supposed right to rule over the Falkland Islands is hammered into the minds of the country’s youth in public schools), it is politically inescapable for anyone in his position to at least pay lip service to the issue.

Given the raw emotion behind the issues — especially in light of the fact that nearly 700 Argentinian servicemen died in the conflict and many more veterans served valiantly — it would be political suicide for anyone, including and especially a president, to be anything less than a hawk on the matter.

Nevertheless, there’s hope that the rhetoric will remain rhetoric, rather than escalate into another conflict. The emphasis on diplomacy as “the only possible way” in the latest statement seems to assure the U.K. and the global community that Buenos Aires has no intention of getting violent this time around. Perhaps it’s a matter of Milei making overtures to his electorate on a hot-button issue while giving a wink and nod to everyone else.

Argentina isn’t likely to withdraw its claims to the Falkland Islands anytime soon. But at least keeping things civil is a win, because ultimately Falklanders have a right to self-determination, and they have made it abundantly clear that they aren’t keen on the prospect of becoming an Argentinian territory, especially given their long cultural ties to Great Britain.

If Milei is smart, he’ll focus on more pressing concerns for Argentina than getting his country involved in another war they’re bound to lose.",Argentina Calls for Negotiations to Acquire Falkland Islands From U.K.,"On Wednesday, the administration of Argentine President Javier Milei issued a statement reasserting its claim to the Falkland Islands and calling on the United Kingdom, which claims the islands as its overseas territory, to reopen bilateral negotiations.

The President of Bolivia has hailed the record bust of cocaine valued at $224 million locally as an “historic result”.

The massive haul of drugs that were hidden in wooden flooring materials found in a truck were displayed to the media in Oruro yesterday.

Bolivian President Luis Arce described the roughly 8.7 metric ton bust as the largest ever recorded in the South American country.

In a post on social media he declared: “Our work, committed to the homeland, is achieving historic results in the fight against drug trafficking,” Arce wrote on X.

“We inform the Bolivian people and the international community that we seized 8.7 tons of cocaine destined for the Netherlands (Europe), which were camouflaged in wooden tiles, transported in a truck,” he said.

“Likewise, four people who were part of this criminal organization were arrested, nine raids were carried out and four properties were seized. The investigations continue,” he added.

It is estimated that the seized drugs were likely destined for the Netherlands where their value would be estimated at some $526 million.

The operation also included the arrest of four suspected drug traffickers, stemming from nine raids, Reuters reported citing government officials.

A series of earthen mounds and buried roads in Ecuador was first noticed more than two decades ago by archaeologist Stéphen Rostain. But at the time, ” I wasn’t sure how it all fit together,” said Rostain, one of the researchers who reported on Thursday’s finding in the journal Science.

Recent mapping by laser-sensor technology revealed those sites to be part of a dense network of settlements and connecting roadways tucked into the forested foothills of the Andes that lasted about 1,000 years.

“It was a lost valley of cities,” said Rostain, who directs investigations at France’s National Center for Scientific Research. “It’s incredible.”

The Upano people occupied the settlements between around 500 B.C. and 300 to 600 A.D. – a period roughly contemporaneous with the Roman Empire in Europe, the researchers found.

Agricultural fields with drainage canals surrounded residential and ceremonial buildings erected on over 6,000 earthen mounds. The most extensive roads were 33 feet (10 meters) wide and stretched 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 kilometers).

While it’s challenging to estimate populations, the site was home to at least 10,000 inhabitants – and perhaps as many as 15,000 or 30,000 at its peak, said archaeologist Antoine Dorison, a study co-author at the same French institute. That’s comparable to the estimated population of Roman-era London, then Britain’s largest city.

“This shows a very dense occupation and an extremely complicated society,” said University of Florida archeologist Michael Heckenberger, who was not involved in the study. “For the region, it’s really in a class of its own in terms of how early it is.”

José Iriarte, a University of Exeter archaeologist, said it would have required an elaborate system of organized labor to build the roads and thousands of earthen mounds.

“The Incas and Mayans built with stone, but people in Amazonia didn’t usually have stone available to build – they built with mud. It’s still an immense amount of labor,” said Iriarte, who had no role in the research.

The Amazon is often considered a “pristine wilderness with only small groups of people. But recent discoveries have shown us how much more complex the past really is,” he said.

Scientists have recently also found evidence of intricate rainforest societies that predated European contact elsewhere in the Amazon, including Bolivia and Brazil.

KUWAIT CITY: Kuwait´s new emir announced an era of “reform” as a government including the first foreign minister from outside the ruling family took the oath of office on Wednesday.

Abdullah al-Yahya, a former ambassador to Argentina, was named in the coveted role as part of a hand-picked cabinet of 13 led by Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Sabah al-Salem Al-Sabah. It is the first government under emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, who came to power last month after the death of his predecessor and half-brother at 86.

Only two cabinet members are from the ruling family: Sheikh Fahad Yousef Al-Sabah, who becomes defence minister and acting interior minister, and Sheikh Firas Saud Al-Malik Al-Sabah, the minister of social affairs and acting minister of state for cabinet affairs.

Nura al-Mashaan, the sole woman, is the new public works and municipal affairs minister, and Dawood Suleiman Marafi, the youngest minister at 42, holds three portfolios -- National Assembly affairs, communications, and youth affairs.

Remitly, a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families, conducted a data study that reveals NZ capital city Wellington is the number one city to find a like-minded community group, with the most Meetup groups per person of any other city in Oceania.

With international migration standing at a historical high, one of the most important things for people to be able to settle in a new city is finding a community of people with similar interests.

Taking this into account, Remitly analysed data from the popular social media app Meetup to discover which cities have the highest number of communities per person. This was revealed by counting the amount of available Meetup groups within the city and surrounding area, and accounting for population size.

The top 10 Oceania cities with the most Meetup groups per person:

In first place was Wellington, offering almost five Meetup groups per 10,000 population, with groups ranging from art loving communities to music appreciation groups. Christchurch ranks in second place. The second largest NZ city, being famed for its world-famous street art and art gallery, offers a total of just over 130 Meetup groups, meaning those new to the area have many opportunities to meet new people and try out a new skill or hobby. Australian capital city Canberra (138 groups) followed in third spot, while bucket list travel spot, Sydney (1,491 groups) and natural beauty, Auckland (423 groups) rounded off the top five.

Two other New Zealand cities rank within the top ten with Dunedin and Nelson ranking in ninth and tenth.

Rank City Country Total no. of Meetup groups Available Meetup groups per 10,000 people 1 Wellington New Zealand 195 4.6 2 Christchurch New Zealand 131 3.2 3 Canberra Australia 138 2.9 4 Sydney Australia 1491 2.9 5 Auckland New Zealand 423 2.5 6 Melbourne Australia 1262 2.4 7 Brisbane Australia 592 2.4 8 Gold Coast Australia 163 2.2 9 Dunedin New Zealand 22 1.9 10 Nelson New Zealand 11 1.8

The global cities with the most Meetup groups per person:

Globally, Remitly’s study shows that the ‘Seattle Freeze’, the name given to the city for its reputation as being a difficult place to make friends, may be thawing. With 1,774 listed Meetup groups in the city ranging from art and culture, to health and wellbeing, Seattle might just be the best place to forge new and meaningful friendships.

The Swiss city of Zurich topped the European rankings ahead of Dublin and Barcelona, whilst Wellington’s laidback lifestyle proved the best place for community spirit in Oceania. Singapore is the number one place to meet new friends in Asia, Buenos Aires was top for Argentina and the port city of Cape Town ranked ahead of Johannesburg and Pretoria as the top community-minded city in Africa.

City Continent Available Meetup groups per 10,000 people Seattle North America 24 Zurich Europe 17 Wellington Oceania 5 Singapore Asia 1.7 Buenos Aires Argentina 0.4 Cape Town Africa 0.3

Jago McKenzie, Business Management Director at Remitly commented: “Alongside finding the right place to work and live, establishing a community of friends who share similar interests is one of the most important aspects of moving to a new city. A strong sense of community can increase your sense of belonging and purpose, and prevent any feelings of isolation and loneliness that can be common when moving somewhere new.

“Community groups and meetups are not new but the way we access them has changed drastically in the social media age, using platforms such as Meetup is a brilliant way to find the best groups for you to connect with quickly and easily. Seattle topping our study was a surprise given its ‘Seattle Freeze’ reputation, but it’s a fantastic and popular place to relocate to, with many new and well-established groups across a variety of different interests. Anyone moving to the city will have an abundance of options to meet like-minded individuals who share the same hobbies and passions.”

Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM), recently recounted step by step how the rejection of the blessing of homosexual couples was handled on the African continent and at the Vatican.

In a recording of an interview posted on the French lay Catholic blog “Le Salon Beige,” the cardinal explained what happened in Africa after the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF), headed by Argentine Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, published the declaration Fiducia Supplicans, which allows the blessing of same-sex couples and couples in irregular situations.

“When on Dec. 18, we received the document Fiducia Supplicans, signed by the prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and co-signed by His Holiness Pope Francis, it caused a shockwave in Africa. We didn’t understand what was happening at the Church level. Furthermore, other churches that called us said: ‘We count on the Catholic Church to oppose this ideology. Now, you are the first to authorize the blessing of homosexual couples.’”

“All of you, all of you, have suffered for this. A lot. Everyone has suffered for this,” the African cardinal lamented.

“The reactions began. And with all responsibility, I wrote to all the episcopal conferences of Africa and Madagascar,” continued the cardinal, who is also the archbishop of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“The episcopal conferences wrote. I printed all the reactions from all the episcopal conferences. I made a synthesis in a document,” he said.

The cardinal said he then wrote a seven-page letter to Pope Francis not only as president of SECAM but also as “his adviser, member of the council of the nine cardinals who accompany the pope for the reform of the Church.”

He then traveled to Rome to meet with the Pontiff, telling one of his private secretaries why he came and giving him all the documentation he had gathered: the reactions of the episcopal conferences, the synthesis and his personal letter.

That same day, the Holy Father received him.

“The Pope was very sad,” the cardinal said. “I must say that he was the first to suffer from all the reactions that came from all over the world. He suffers for it because he is a human being. This doesn’t make him happy.”

“I reached an agreement with him because I told him that the solution to this issue is no longer to send us documents with theological or philosophical definitions of blessings. The people are not interested in that. What is of interest now is a communication that reassures the people in Africa, that calms the spirits of the faithful. And he, as a pastor, was touched by this situation,” the African cardinal continued.

The Holy Father put the African cardinal in contact with Cardinal Fernández, who agreed to work with him the next day at the DDF, “the most important dicastery from the point of view of the Catholic faith.”

“With the prefect, myself in front of the computer, a secretary writing, we prepared a document,” Cardinal Ambongo Besungu said. “And we prepared the document in dialogue and agreement with Pope Francis, so that at every moment we called him to ask him questions, to see if he agreed with that formulation, etc.”

When completed, the African cardinal said, “I signed the document as president of SECAM on behalf of the entire Catholic Church in Africa. And the prefect of the dicastery signed it, not the document that was made public, but the document that we keep in the archives. The document is titled ‘No to the Blessing of Homosexual Couples in the Catholic Churches.’”

The cardinal clarified that, although the text appears to have been signed in Accra, Ghana, the headquarters of SECAM, in reality, he said, “I signed it in Rome.”

“This is to express our position today in Africa, and we do it in a spirit of communion, of synodality with Pope Francis, and with the prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith: In Africa there is no place to bless homosexual couples. Not at all,” he stressed.

On Jan. 11, SECAM published a five-page statement stating: “The Episcopal Conferences of all Africa, which have strongly reaffirmed their communion with Pope Francis, believe that the extra-liturgical blessings proposed in the declaration Fiducia Supplicans cannot be carried out in Africa without exposing themselves to scandals.”





Individual Blessings

The cardinal also stressed that, although Africa opposes the blessing of same-sex couples, it is necessary to “respect homosexual people because they are human beings. We should not look at them, treat them with contempt. They are creatures of God. And as creatures of God, if an individual homosexual asks for a blessing, we bless the person. We can bless him as a person.”

After noting that criminals can also be blessed, the cardinal pointed out that these blessings for individual persons are given “in the hope that the grace of the blessing can help them convert. And if we bless a homosexual, it is also to say that ‘your sexual orientation is not in accordance with the will of God and we hope that the blessing can help you change because homosexuality is condemned in the Bible and by the magisterium of the Church.’”

“We cannot be promoters of sexual deviation. Let them do it in their homes, but not in ours,” he said.





Marriage and Family in Africa vs. the West

The cardinal also lamented that, currently in “the West, since they don’t like children, they want to attack the basic cell of humanity, which is the family. If you destroy the family, you destroy society.”

The cardinal lamented that now in the West the meaning of marriage has also been lost and culture “is in decline,” something that also affects the economy. “Little by little, they are going to disappear. They will disappear. We wish them a good demise,” he continued.

The cardinal also denounced the action of international organizations such as the U.N., UNICEF and the World Health Organization, among others, which condition their financing on the promotion of gender ideology, which does not recognize the natural sexual difference between men and women.

“However, our culture in Africa is not like that. Yes, we have many defects, but we cannot be reproached for homosexuality. You can find isolated cases, like those in Uganda,” he said, but “society doesn’t work that way. That practice does not exist among us.”

The labor chapter of the president’s sweeping mega-decree is currently suspended thanks to a temporary stay, but this ruling means that unless Congress green-lights the decree, those six articles are permanently nixed. The proposals targeted union payments, limits to working hours, collective bargaining rules, and the right to strike.

Milei announced the controversial mega-decree on December 21, 10 days asfter his inauguration, and it went into effect on December 29. It has been the subject of several legal challenges and protective writs which aim to declare it null or unconstitutional as a whole or in sections.

So far, the judiciary has only advanced favorably on a writ filed by the General Confederation of Labor (CGT by its Spanish initials) which led to the labor reform freeze. Last week, the writ was sent to the Supreme Court for a final decision.

In Argentina, presidents are banned from legislating except in cases that are so urgent and necessary that they can’t wait to pass through Congress. That’s why DNUs exist. However, Judge Liliana Rodríguez Fernández pointed out in her ruling that Congress is operational and “what’s more, the Executive Branch itself asked for the DNU to be ratified during the extraordinary sessions.”

“I am not making a value judgment on the eventual need for some of the proposed reforms, but the urgency invoked over them clearly does not apply,” the judge said. “The constitutional requirements for using such an instrument have not been met here, making it invalid.”

Beyond judicial disputes, the DNU could also be stopped by Congress by a majority vote in both chambers. Five senators from the opposition bloc Unión por la Patria have requested addressing it in a special session with both chambers for next Thursday, but so far Vice President Victoria Villarruel, head of the Senate, has not accepted.



Meanwhile, a session to discuss the omnibus bill, which complements the DNUs reforms, is expected to take place next week, although a date hasn’t been confirmed yet.",Judge nixes six labor reform articles from Milei’s mega-decree,"A top labor court annulled six articles included in the labor reform section of President Javier Milei’s economic deregulation mega-decree of necessity and urgency, known as DNU, on Thursday.

Pension reforms and some of the most controversial articles on protest have been axed — but the privatization of over 40 state companies, the stripping of environmental protections, and other aspects of protest legislation remain untouched. Here’s what’s still in there.

Some of these articles could still be struck down later in the debate.

The most recent changes were agreed during a legislative commission session on Tuesday and announced Wednesday during the ongoing session. Other segments were removed over the past week, such as the elimination of the fiscal reform chapter and the delegation of legislative powers to Milei on fiscal, healthcare and pensions issues.

The changes also nix a portion that deregulated fishing regulations for foreigners in the Argentine sea, which had stirred conflict among governors.

However, the elimination of a large section of the security chapter targeting social protest and an article on the budget to protect native forests was a surprise.

Last week, the UN sent a document to the government asking it to revise articles in the omnibus bill and the security ministry’s anti-protest protocol regarding social protest, saying they violate human rights standards. Deputies have now eliminated six of those articles from the bill.

The social protest articles that were removed defined gatherings or protests as the temporary congregation of 30 people or more to protest, called for the security ministry to be notified of spontaneous protests as soon as possible for authorization, and created a legal definition of protest organizers.

“This is a brutal attack on the people’s right to organize and protest,” left-wing deputy Romina Del Plá told the Herald.

Controversial articles that would have changed how pensions were calculated and allowed funds used to pay for pensions to be transferred to the national treasury were also left out, as was one that raised some export duties and another that would have ended the PAIS tax at the end of 2024.

Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) deputy Martín Tetaz said removing those articles was “a brilliant decision,” adding that the changes were in line with the points the UCR rejected. The party plans to back the bill in general.

“I think it’s important they decided to leave out the pensions modification, and there are improvements in the discussion of the rest of the articles,” he added.

What’s still in the bill

The privatization of 41 state-owned companies, one of the most controversial parts of the bill, was left untouched. This is a government priority — some LLA members had even threatened to call off the session if other deputies attempted to modify it. Like the rest of the articles, it could still be rejected or modified during the session, since most blocs don’t fully agree with it.

If the bill passes in the Lower and Upper Houses and there are no further modifications, Milei will have special powers to legislate over economic, financial, security, tariffs, energy and administrative issues until the end of 2024. Congress could extend that period for another year.

Most of the environment chapter was left untouched, including reforms to a law protecting glaciers, and broader permission to burn fields. However, several sources told the Herald that this part is likely to be rejected by most blocs, and could ultimately be removed.

Many sections targeting social protest were also left untouched, including those ordering march organizers to pay for damage incurred during the protest, prohibiting the presence of minors at protests, and requesting social movements to notify the Security Ministry 48 hours before a march. The ministry would still have the power to reject a march after they are notified.

“I am very worried about the privatization of over 40 state-owned companies, the government being allowed to take unlimited debt, and the environment chapter,” Unión por la Patria deputy Julia Strada told the Herald. “They want to bulldoze forests and glaciers for extractivism.”

Tetaz said that, while the bill is “much better,” the UCR will reject articles linked to the reform of culture laws and the Criminal and Commercial codes. “The privatizations discussion is still not settled, the final list of the companies that could be privatized is still being discussed.”

A source from LLA told the Herald that there is “widespread backing for the privatizations” and envisaged minor modifications of that section at most.",The original omnibus bill has been cut in half.

President Gabriel Boric has decreed a state of emergency in the central and southern parts of the country ""due to catastrophe,"" as dry conditions and temperatures soaring to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) exacerbated the crisis.

""There are 40 people who were killed in the fire, and another six (who died) as a result of burns,"" Boric said, after he surveyed the affected region via helicopter Saturday afternoon.

""We know that these (numbers) will increase,"" he added.

After the flight he promised, ""We will be there as a government to help them get back up (on their feet).""

Dense gray smoke blanketed the Vina del Mar area of the Valparaiso tourist region, along central Chile's coastline, forcing residents to flee their homes.

Authorities imposed a curfew beginning at 9 pm (0000 GMT) Saturday, to allow emergency supplies -- especially fuel -- into the affected areas. New evacuation orders were issued, though it remained unclear exactly how many people have been told to leave.

Earlier Saturday, Interior Minister Carolina Toha said there had been 92 fires as of noon, with 43,000 hectares (106,000 acres) burned across the country. Firefighters were still battling 29 of the blazes by the afternoon, while 40 had been brought under control.

In the hillsides around the coastal city of Vina del Mar, entire blocks of houses were burned out overnight, AFP reporters saw Saturday morning, as thousands of people who had previously evacuated returned to find their homes destroyed.

Some of the dead were seen lying in the road, covered by sheets.

The area, about 1.5 hours northwest of the capital Santiago, is a popular tourist destination during the summer months. The coastal region is also important for the country's wine, agricultural and logging industries.

In the towns of Estrella and Navidad, southwest of the capital, the fires burned nearly 30 homes, and forced evacuations near the surfing resort of Pichilemu.

""I've never seen anything like it,"" 63-year-old Yvonne Guzman told AFP. When the flames started to close in on her home in Quilpue, she fled with her elderly mother, only to be trapped in traffic for hours.

""It's very distressing, because we've evacuated the house but we can't move forward. There are all these people trying to get out and who can't move,"" she said.

Vina del Mar Mayor Macarena Ripamonti said, ""We're facing an unprecedented catastrophe, a situation of this magnitude has never happened in the Valparaiso region.""

'Extreme'

Several thousand hectares have burned in Valparaiso alone, according to CONAF, the Chilean national forest authority.

Images from trapped motorists have gone viral online, showing mountains in flames at the end of the famous ""Route 68,"" a road traveled by thousands of tourists to reach the Pacific coast.

In addition to Valparaiso, firefighters and emergency services personnel were battling blazes in the center and south of Chile, including O'Higgins, Maule, Biobio, La Araucania and Los Lagos.

""This was an inferno,"" Rodrigo Pulgar, who lost his home in the inland town of El Olivar, told AFP. ""I tried to help my neighbor... my house was starting to burn behind us. It was raining ash.""

On Friday, authorities closed the road linking Valparaiso to the capital Santiago, as a huge mushroom cloud of smoke ""reduced visibility.""

The fires are being driven by a summer heatwave and drought affecting the southern part of South America caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, as scientists warn that a warming planet has increased the risk of natural disasters such as intense heat and fires.

As Chile and Colombia battle rising temperatures, the heatwave is also threatening to sweep over Paraguay and Brazil.

In Argentina, brigades from several provinces have been fighting a fire that has consumed more than 3,000 hectares in Los Alerces National Park, famed for its beauty and biodiversity, since January 25.

The Biden Administration, bending the knee to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, has paused approval of new LNG export facilities . (In terms of influence on the President, this “wing” is looking more like the breasts, the thighs and drumsticks, the other wing, and the piece that went over the fence last. No news from the giblets).

What would a permanent ban, which could result after the government conducts its “robust” examination of LNG exports, look like? In NR Capital Matters, Andrew Follett refers to it as a “ strategic crippling that would cost already wavering American allies to reconsider cozying up to the Kremlin, cut the heart out of the booming American natural gas industry, and likely increase American energy prices in the long term.” What other choices would our allies have? Europe’s already dwindling economic output will diminish even further, and the US will forego the opportunity to reduce our trade deficit. Other perils abound: increasing use of CO2-emitting coal is an obvious one and losing market share in Asia to ambitious Qatar and Iran is another.

The move was not popular everywhere . It will immediately shut down four pending projects at enormous cost to investors and lost jobs.

“Here’s reality: LNG is going to be produced. It is going to be sold on the global market. It is going to be used. Those things will happen whether new export terminals are built or not,” says Andrew Stuttaford in National Review’s Capital Matters . A ban will not impact global warming.

Virtue abounds

The mayor of London has signed on to a treaty sponsored by the World Economic Forum requiring London to ban meat , dairy and private car ownership by 2030 , says Timothy Gardner of Planet Today. It’s the initiative from the C40 Cities (C40Cities,org). The proposals include “climate action plans” that include “consumption interventions” such as prohibiting citizens from purchasing no more than three items of clothing a year and flying more than once every three years. I want to be there when they tell Leonardo DiCaprio, John Kerry, and their fellow climate warriors. The details are vague and inisidously non-threatening.

Speaking of Davos, the new exquisitely coiffed president of Argentina, Javier Milie, presented the argument for a capitalist alternative to the socialist leaning group-think of the global elite attendees.

… and of governments. Here is a cute story about two governors , a coyote and a dog .

Are you being told the truth?

“Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late; the jest is over, and the tale hath had its effect.” Jonathan Swift.

… which leads to the myriad untruths your government is telling you about the journey to “Net Zero”, says James Varney in RealClearInvestigations. How much land is required for a windmill? Orders of magnitude more than you are being told.

And dissent is stifled says John Murawski in RealClearInvestigations. He cites the critics’ reasoning, banned from the official discourse, behind why there should not be concern about a “crisis”. Remember, the ones who control the data control the debate.

According to the Chamber of Electricity Trading (CCEE), this was the largest volume in the country’s history. The benefit for Brazil was reported to reach BRL 888 million, an amount that helps reduce the cost of production at hydroelectric plants and the impact on tariffs for Brazilian consumers, which are proportional to the total exported.

Alexandre Ramos, chairman of CCEE’s Board of Directors, told Agência Brasil that this volume was exported in two phases between January and December 2023, one of them corresponds to the export of energy from the hydroelectric generation of 354 average megawatts, 86 percent of which went to Argentina. The operation, Ramos noted, brought in BRL 106 million in revenues reverted to the tariffs paid by consumers.

The remaining portion stems from hydroelectric power, which comes back in the form of a reduction in the value paid by hydroelectric plants. “A part of these amounts is reverted to consumers, especially in the case of the plants within the quota system,” said Ramos, adding that exports of this type of energy amounted to 490 average megawatts—77 percent of which went to Argentina and the rest to Uruguay, “generating a benefit for the [mechanism] of around BRL 782 million,” he concluded.

The excess water in the reservoirs is used for power generation. Ramos pointed out that the demand from the Argentinian and Uruguayan markets coincided with a fairly positive scenario for Brazil, as reservoirs recovered in the wet season.

The renewable energy produced by wind and solar power plants contributed to this scenario. The priority, however, is supplying the Brazilian grid. According to the president, there is no forecast for exports at the beginning of the year due to the heat, which should increase consumer demand for energy in Brazil.

The Chamber of Electricity Trading is a non-profit association responsible for the purchase and sale of electricity in Brazil, ensuring that this essential resource reaches Brazilians as well as productive sectors.

Carnival dancers took the biggest stage in Rio de Janeiro with their faces painted red in a traditional Indigenous manner while percussionists had “Miners out” written across the skins of their drums.

It was part of the samba school Salgueiro’s tribute to the Yanomami, Brazil’s largest Indigenous group, with its giant floats, costumes and songs based on the group’s ancient culture and traditions.

“My Salgueiro is the arrow for the people of the forest,” the parade participants sang out as they marched through the arena known as the Sambadrome, delivering their message to more than 70,000 revelers at the venue and millions watching live on television into early Monday. “The chance that’s left for us is an Indigenous Brazil.”

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is under pressure to deliver on promises to eradicate illegal mining, particularly amid a recent backslide in efforts. The parade at the Sambadrome came as Brazil celebrated one year since Lula declared a public health emergency for the Yanomami people in the Amazon, who are suffering from malnutrition and diseases such as malaria as a consequence of illegal mining.

“Ours is a cry for help from Brazil and the world in general,” said Davi Kopenawa, a Yanomami leader and shaman who advised the samba school on how to remain truthful to his people, and paraded with Salgueiro. “My hope is that the world, upon hearing our call, will put pressure on the Brazilian government to remove all the miners, destroyers of our Mother Earth, who are soiling the water and killing fish.”

Kopenawa paraded with feathered armbands and headdress, plus a beaded necklace depicting a jaguar. He was joined by 13 other Yanomami who flew across the country to participate in Salgueiro’s parade. One of the first floats consisted of a severed tree trunk, with a performer depicting a Yanomami mother seeking to protect her child as invaders drew close. Other floats featured massive sculptures of Yanomami people.

Through this homage to Yanomami history and culture, Salgueiro sought to draw attention to the devastating effects brought by illegal mining inside Yanomami territory, including widespread river contamination, famine and disease.

Some 30,000 Yanomami live in Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory, spanning more than 22 million acres in the northern area of the Amazon rain forest along the border with Venezuela.

Three weeks after assuming the presidency, Lula declared a public health emergency and sent in the armed forces, doctors, nurses and food. Still, more than 300 Yanomami died of various causes in 2023, according to the Health Ministry.

Lula swiftly created a dedicated inter-ministerial task force to fight illegal mining, and in 2023, Brazil’s environmental agency destroyed a record 33 aircraft found on or near Yanomami territory. The agents also wrecked or apprehended mining barges, fuel, chain saws, Starlink internet units and campsites.

Government officials say that since the beginning of the operation, areas with illegal mining inside Yanomami territory have dropped 85% and that the health of the Yanomami has improved.

But after the operation’s initial success, prosecutors, law enforcement and employees of federal environmental agencies say illegal miners are returning.

“There has been a significant reduction, but mining hasn’t ended. We reckon that the miners are exploiting as much as possible, because they assess they eventually will have to leave,” Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection at Brazil’s environmental agency Ibama, told the Associated Press.

He said miners have adapted to escape law enforcement and satellite detection by working at night, setting camp under the forest canopy and choosing old mining pits instead of clearing forest to open new ones.

Humberto Freire, director of the newly created Amazon and environmental unit of the federal police, said officers also noticed miners have begun working in a much smaller, artisanal way, and that government agencies need to take stronger action.

“We need, for example, the air force to effectively control the airspace over Yanomami land. We need the navy to control the flow of people on rivers. We need the army to do a quality job, too,” Freire said. “The federal police can do more, the armed forces can do more, as well as Ibama and Funai” — the Indigenous affairs agency, he said.

One of the parade’s wings featured dancers dressed in the dark-green garb of army uniforms. Following behind was a float featuring two giant army hats with skulls, an explicitly critical element of the parade.

Lula had said the armed forces would play a key role in the fight, providing logistical support and security to public workers and federal agents on the ground who say they increasingly fear for their lives.

But it isn’t the military’s responsibility to engage in direct combat, according to political scientist João Roberto Martins Filho. Still, the big question is why the army, which has three permanent bases inside Yanomami territory, didn’t sound the alarm under Lula’s predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.

“There was nearly a massacre of an unprotected population. Why did the army let this happen instead of denouncing it to the federal government or reaching out to the press?” Martins Filho, a professor at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, told the AP. “In a certain way, they were accomplices.”

In a written response to the AP, the army said that illegal mining and the health crisis within the Yanomami territory “are complex issues involving the legal jurisdiction of various government agencies” and that the army is “always prepared to fulfill its strategic missions.” That includes providing support to federal agencies through logistical, communication and intelligence activities, such as those being conducted in the Yanomami territory, the statement said.

Illegal planes are essential for transporting prospectors and equipment to far-flung reserves, as shown in a 2022 Associated Press investigation in Roraima state, where most mining affecting the Yanomami takes place. Without unauthorized aircraft, officials and experts have said, illegal mining operations would collapse.

After a January 2023 presidential decree ordered the air force to close the airspace over Yanomami territory, the situation improved significantly, authorities and Indigenous people told the AP.

In a written response to the AP, Brazil’s air force said it has been patrolling the so-called Air Defense Identification Zone over the Yanomami territory. Under this rule, an aircraft may be shot down for failing to obey orders to change route. The force claims the measure led to a 90% reduction in illegal flights.

“It’s highly efficient. We would find landing strips, but no planes,” said André Luiz Porreca Ferreira Cunha, a federal prosecutor who oversees cases linked to illegal mining across the western Amazon.

But some on the ground suggest the armed forces are no longer sufficiently involved in operations, and that illegal miners started coming back as a result.

In a joint statement last month, the associations representing federal workers in environmental and Indigenous affairs accused the armed forces of “failing to fulfill their mission of supporting and facilitating the work of other agencies” combating illegal mining. The association alleged that the military denied use of aircraft for transporting personnel and equipment, haven’t collaborated in the destruction of mining machinery and airstrips and instead shut down support points for refueling environmental agency aircraft.

Ferreira Cunha, the prosecutor, said violent attacks on Ibama agents and members of the federal police are becoming more frequent, with some cases of attempted murder. Government health teams have also been targeted, and are unable — or unwilling — to reach certain communities, said Júnior Hekurari, a member of the group and president of Condisi-Y, the local health council.

“Some are heavily armed; the health teams are scared,” he said.

“This state of emergency cannot solve the problem. We need something permanent, for all the communities,” Hekurari added. “If they [government authorities] don’t stay, the miners will return tomorrow.”",Rio’s Carnival parade makes urgent plea to stop illegal mining in Indigenous lands,"“The chance that’s left for us is an Indigenous Brazil.”AdvertisementA Brazil Environmental Agency helicopter flies over an illegal mining camp in Yanomami Indigenous territory, Roraima state, Brazil, last year.

LONDON (AP) — British Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Monday toured battle sites of the Falklands War during a visit meant to underline that the Falkland Islands are a “valued part of the British family.”

The visit by Cameron — the first British foreign secretary to make the trip to the South Atlantic archipelago in three decades — came amid renewed calls by Argentina for negotiations over the contested territory.

Cameron said he hoped that the islands would wish to remain part of the British “family” forever.

“As long as the Falkland Islands want to be part of the U.K. family they are absolutely welcome to be part of that family and we will support them and back them and help protect and defend them absolutely, as far as I’m concerned, for as long as they want,” he said. “And I hope that’s for a very, very long time, possibly forever.”

The politician was taken on a helicopter tour of the islands and stopped at two battle sites in the 1982 Falklands War. He also visited a cemetery and paid respects to the war dead.

The islands, which lie about 300 miles (480 kilometers) from South America and 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) from Britain, have long been a source of tension between Argentina and the U.K.

Argentina argues that the islands were illegally taken from it in 1833. Britain, which says its territorial claim dates to 1765, sent a warship to the islands in 1833 to expel Argentine forces who had sought to establish sovereignty over the territory.

Argentina invaded the islands in 1982, triggering a two-month war, won by Britain, that killed 649 Argentine troops, 255 British servicemen and three islanders.

Islanders voted overwhelmingly in a 2013 referendum to remain a British Overseas Territory.

Argentina’s recently elected President Javier Milei has called for the islands — known as the Islas Malvinas in Argentina — to be handed over to Buenos Aires.

Cameron said the U.K.’s relationship with the Argentine government “will never be at the expense of the wishes of the Falkland Islanders, who in our view absolutely come first.”

Britain’s Foreign Office said that the two countries “would agree to disagree, and do so politely” over the issue.

(Bruna Prado/AP)

RIO DE JANEIRO — The U.S. opposition to an immediate cease-fire in Gaza came under repeated criticism during a two-day meeting of the chief diplomats of the world’s 20 largest economies in the latest sign of Washington’s isolation on the issue.

Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, the host of this year’s annual Group of 20 gathering, began the meeting by decrying the “paralysis” at the United Nations Security Council, where Washington vetoed a third resolution for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza earlier in the week.

“This state of inaction results in the loss of innocent lives,” Vieira said.

The top diplomats at the gathering, which included Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, offered their views on various geopolitical issues in a session that was closed to the media so officials could express themselves more candidly.

But by mistake, a small group of journalists, including from The Washington Post, were able to listen in on the session because the audio headsets continued broadcasting the remarks, unbeknownst to the Brazilian hosts.

Australia, a close ally of the United States, supported an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and strongly warned about the “further devastation” that could result from Israel’s announced military campaign in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million displaced Palestinians have sought shelter.

“We say again to Israel — do not go down this path,” said Australia’s representative, Katy Gallagher. “This would be unjustifiable.”

South Africa, which has accused Israel of carrying out a genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel strenuously denies, said world leaders had “allowed impunity to hold sway.”

“We have failed the people of Palestine,” said Naledi Pandor, South Africa’s minister of international relations and cooperation.

The accidentally broadcast remarks created a sharp contrast with the G-20 gathering in India last year, where Blinken sought to unite world powers in condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the time, Blinken found a more receptive audience when he invoked the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty to criticize Moscow’s land grab.

But in Brazil, diplomats invoked those same principles to criticize the ongoing war in Gaza, where the United States has provided Israel political cover and billions of dollars’ worth of bombs and military equipment.

“If, for example, we had been united” behind the “principles set out in the U.N. Charter,” said South Africa’s representative, “the tragedy in Palestine will not have lasted over three months.”

Analysts said the contrast between Washington’s global standing from one year to the next was stark.

“A year ago, the U.S. had Russia on the back foot over Ukraine,” said Richard Gowan, an expert on multilateral affairs at the International Crisis Group. “Now the Biden administration looks like it is losing its grip on events in Ukraine and Gaza, and could lose its grip on the November elections too.”

Among Latin American countries, the United States received a rare reprieve during the remarks by Argentina, whose recently elected libertarian leader, Javier Milei, is staunchly pro-Israel.

While acknowledging that the conflict has caused a “humanitarian disaster,” Argentina’s representative condemned the “terrorist acts of Hamas” and demanded the “unconditional release of hostages.”

U.S. officials said they remained focused on working toward Brazil’s goals for the G-20, including coordination on labor practices, climate change and food security. They said they hoped that differences over Gaza would not derail those efforts, but comments from Brazil’s president days before Blinken’s arrival comparing the slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza to the genocide of Jews during World War II provided another obstacle.

During the top U.S. diplomat’s meeting Wednesday with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Blinken “made clear that we disagree with those comments,” said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive hour-and-a-half discussion between the two leaders. “I would say the two had a frank exchange.”

As president of Latin America’s most populous country and host of the G-20, Lula has taken on an outsize role as a voice of the developing world when it comes to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, in both cases criticizing Washington’s opposition to an immediate cease-fire.

In the meeting, Blinken made clear his view that the United States did not support an immediate cease-fire because it would leave Hamas in place to repeat attacks against Israel, said the senior official.

U.S. intelligence officials say Israel’s forces have significantly degraded Hamas’s capabilities but estimate that they are not close to eliminating the group after more than 100 days of war and nearly 30,000 Palestinians killed, according to figures from Gaza’s health ministry. The assault began Oct. 7 after Hamas fighters invaded southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostage.

Lula weighed in Sunday on the large number of civilian casualties in the war, accusing Israel of carrying out a “genocide” and comparing it to “when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on social media that Lula was “trivializing” the Holocaust and “trying to harm the Jewish people and Israel’s right to defend itself.”

Blinken relayed to Lula U.S. efforts to broker a deal between Hamas and Israel that would see the release of prisoners in exchange for a humanitarian pause in fighting and an increase in humanitarian aid.",US increasingly isolated at G-20 as Gaza crisis worsens,"“We say again to Israel — do not go down this path,” said Australia’s representative, Katy Gallagher.

Chubut governor Ignacio Torres said the ruling meant the province would no longer interrupt oil and gas supplies, as he had previously threatened.

The national administration will appeal the ruling, news agency Télam reported. “In the next few hours, [the government] will analyze and define the legal instruments with which this appeal will be carried out,” a Casa Rosada source said. The National Treasury Attorney’s Office is reportedly considering taking the case straight to the Supreme Court.

On Friday, Chubut governor Ignacio Torres said he would stop delivering oil and gas to the rest of Argentina unless the national government released AR$13.5 billion in tax revenues. All but one of Argentina’s governors soon came out to back him. President Javier Milei called the warning a “Chavista threat” and claimed the national government was subtracting a debt owed by Chubut from the funds it was delivering.

The national government has axed a range of funds destined for Argentine provinces in recent weeks, triggering a dispute with the governors. Teachers in several provinces were on strike Monday after the government refused to pay into a fund that contributes to their wages, while a fund that subsidized public transport fees has also been axed.

The Milei administration argues these cuts are necessary to eliminate Argentina’s fiscal deficit, but they are widely interpreted as retaliatory measures against the provinces after the bill collapsed due to a lack of support in Congress, which Milei blamed on governors.

Torres said that with Tuesday’s ruling, the conflict — and therefore the threat to cut oil and gas deliveries — was over. The decision was taken by the federal court in the city of Rawson, Chubut. Judge Hugo Sastre ruled in Torres’s favor in a lawsuit he filed on the matter last week.

Sastre’s ruling will remain in force until the national and provincial governments refinance Chubut’s debt, with a deadline of the end of the year. The judge also urged the parties to “find ways to cancel and/or refinance the debt, under reasonable conditions, which do not involve compromising the provincial government’s essential services.”

On Tuesday, after the ruling, Patagonian provincial governors called for negotiations with the national government to solve the conflict.

The proposal was made at a press conference held in the National Senate. It was attended by the following governors:

Ignacio Torres (Chubut)

Sergio Zilliotto (La Pampa)

Rolando Figueroa (Neuquén)

Alberto Weretilneck (Río Negro)

Santa Cruz Governor Claudio Vidal was connected via Zoom, while Tierra del Fuego’s Gustavo Melella was absent.

“The issue has led to a false rift between the national and provincial states,” Torres said during the press conference. “Argentina needs unity and for us to reach an agreement, we do not have time for ideological discussions when we have to guarantee health and education.”

Milei did not comment on the ruling, but liked a post by an anonymous X user saying in all caps: “Unexpected: Chubut’s judiciary rules in favor of Chubut.”","Chubut will not withhold oil and gas following favorable tax ruling, says governor","Chubut governor Ignacio Torres said the ruling meant the province would no longer interrupt oil and gas supplies, as he had previously threatened.

“You already know the details,” Adorni said. “The ‘e’, the ‘@,’ the ‘x’ will not be allowed and the unnecessary inclusion of the feminine in public administration documents will be avoided.”

In Spanish, all nouns, adjectives, articles, and pronouns have a gender, and the universal is masculine by default. The masculine form usually ends in “o,” while the feminine usually ends in “a.” Thus, the masculine todos (everybody) applies to groups of men and groups of mixed gender. The feminine todas is only used if the whole group is female.

To avoid equating the masculine with the universal, some people use an @, an x, or an e at the end of words. The gender-neutral version of todos becomes tod@s, todxs, or todes. Others use both the feminine and masculine: todos y todas.

The demand for gender-neutral language is prioritized by feminist, queer and nonbinary groups, who point out that the gender-binary language and the generic masculine erase their existence.

During the Alberto Fernández presidency, various state institutions adopted gender-neutral language. Fernández, whose child is nonbinary, sometimes used gender-neutral language such as argentine in interviews.

The Royal Academy of the Spanish Language (RAE) does not support gender-neutral language, as it does not consider the generic masculine to be a problem for gender equality. However, critics say the academy’s stance is too conservative. Asked about people who disagree with the RAE’s recommendations, Adorni said that the government would not wade into the debate.

“We believe that politics has used gender perspectives for profit,” he said.

In a country known in recent years for feminist organizing such as the #NiUnaMenos movement and victories such as the 2020 legalization of abortion, Milei has consistently adopted anti-feminist positions. When he took power, he shut down the Women, Genders, and Diversity Ministry established by the Fernández administration, and he has said he views abortion as aggravated homicide.

In early February, deputies from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza coalition presented a bill to overturn the legalization of abortion, although the deputy who signed the bill filed it of her own initiative.

Deputy Lilia Lemoine, a close Milei ally, also sparked controversy on the campaign trail after stating during an interview that pregnant women should be required to tell the father within two weeks so he can decide whether he wants to take responsibility for the child or not.

On Friday, Defense Ministry Luis Petri announced that he had banned gender-neutral language in the Armed Forces. He signed a resolution establishing that failure to comply with the new rules would result in unspecified “punishments.”",Government to ban gender-neutral language in national public bodies,"The Argentine government will ban the use of gender-neutral language in national public institutions, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said on Tuesday.

Ofelia Payá, widow of late Oswaldo Payá, sued Victor Manuel Rocha in Miami, Florida, alleging Rocha was an “accomplice” to the late activist’s “assassination”, according to the AP.

Rocha “directly aided Cuban officials by providing them with critical intelligence that he obtained through his Top-Secret security clearance and influential roles,” Ofelia Payá’s lawsuit reportedly alleged. “Cuba would not have been able to execute Mr. Payá with impunity without Defendant conspiring with and providing intelligence and aid to Cuba’s dictatorship.”

The lawsuit further alleged that Rocha secretly supported Cuba’s late longtime dictator Fidel Castro’s regime using his position as a special adviser to the head of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in Miami from 2006 to 2012 as a “veneer of loyalty and service to the United States,” the AP reported. Rocha, a former U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, reportedly took up the position after retiring from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2002.

No evidence demonstrating any link between Rocha and Payá’s demise is provided by the lawsuit, according to the outlet (RELATED: DOJ Charges Ex-US Official For Allegedly Working As A Cuban Spy Over Decades)

SOUTHCOM’s area of responsibility reportedly includes Cuba. Oswaldo Payá was a critic of the Cuban regime through his grassroots Christian group, the Varela Project, defending human freedoms and right to assembly, the AP reported.

The AP said it reviewed clandestine diplomatic communications Wikileaks published. In doing so, the outlet discovered for nearly two years from 2006 to 2008, American diplomats in Havana provided the commanding officer of SouthCom information on Payá’s undertakings, U.S. monetary backing and his communications with U.S. officials.

A former US ambassador will plead guilty to charges of spying for Cuba for decades, court records showed, in what the Justice Department described as one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the US government by a foreign agent.

Report says Victor Manuel Rocha, who served as US ambassador to Bolivia from 2000 to 2002, was charged in December with committing multiple federal crimes, including acting as an illegal foreign agent and using a fraudulently obtained passport.

The US had accused Rocha of having secretly supported Cuba and its clandestine intelligence-gathering mission against Washington since 1981.

Meanwhile, he pleaded not guilty in mid-February and the parties in the case announced he “will be changing his plea,” according to an entry in the US online court records system. It added that a sentencing was set for April 12.

Rocha was arrested in December. His legal representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Rocha worked for the State Department from 1981 to 2002, the Justice Department said when he was charged. He served on the White House’s National Security Council from 1994 to 1995, and worked as an adviser to the commander of the US military’s Southern Command from around 2006 to around 2012, the department added.

Rocha admitted his decades of work for Cuba in a series of meetings in 2022 and 2023 with an undercover FBI agent who posed as a covert Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence representative, according to a court document.

Following his comments, El Salvador's Ministry of Education announced that it will stop teaching gender theory to children.

""Confirmed: we have removed all traces of gender ideology from public schools,"" Minister of Education José Mauricio Pineda told El Pais.

Bukele, 42, won his re-election bid with 84% of thevote, while his Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) party is now the primary political force in the country. They have widespread support of the Salvadorian population, which is in alignment on issues such as gender theory and sex education.

According to Pineda, ""every use or trace of gender ideology"" has been ""removed from public schools.""

Salvadorian feminists are of course screeching over the decision.

""Bukele is a messianic figure, a patriarchal leader… a [paternalistic] president who watches over us and who [seems to think that he’s] anointed by God,"" said human rights activist Celia Medrano, in a statement to El Pais. ""He’s a highly conservative man with a very clear tendency to manipulate religion [in favor of] the message that women have to be kept at home.""

Meanwhile in Argentina, President Javier Milei is on a similar mission to undo years of feminist policies - demoting the Minister of Women, Gender and Diversity to the level of undersecretary, and announcing that the government will prohibit so-called 'inclusive' language and ""anything related to the gender perspective"" in the administration.

The country's 144 telephone line for victims of gender-based violence, and shelters created for them, were recently eliminated as part of recent budget cuts.

In response, feminist movements will be out in force on March 8, International Women's Day.

Beyond El Salvador and Argentina, in Columbia, voters rejected a peace agreement between the Santos government and FARC guerillas - because among other things, the agreements included a push for equality between men, women, LGBTQ+ and other 'diverse' identities.

The rejection that took place at the polls that October had been brewing for months. Evangelical and Catholic groups, with the support of former president Álvaro Uribe’s party, had taken to the streets that summer to protest against the government’s “indoctrination in gender identity” due to its guidelines on sexuality. ... María Fernanda Cabal, the leading senator of the most radical right wing, is a firm defender of these theses. She repeated the phrase: “Gender ideology is disgusting.” -El Pais

One of the earliest leaders to reject DEI and gender ideology was former President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro - whose government attempted to eliminate gender perspective in schools, only to be struck down by the country's Supreme Court as being unconstitutional.

That said, Bolsonaro’s head of cultural policy did veto 'inclusive language' from projects seeking tax beneffits, and the former president himself mocked the Argentine government after Alberto Fernández insisted on using such language in his official commnications.

""How does that help your people? The only thing that has changed is that now there are shortages, poverty, and unemployment. May God protect our Argentine brothers and help us get out of this difficult situation,"" he said.

El Pais also notes Chile and the ""ultraconservatives of Mexico"" as opposing gender ideology.

""Let’s recover the language, no more cultural deformation,"" said Chilean Republican Party under José Antonio Kast during his first presidential run ahead of the country's 2021 elections. ""the so-called inclusive language is part of a political-ideological agenda, and not a cultural agenda. We are going to strengthen the correct use of language, with no forced imposition of its deviations or discrimination of any kind.""

In short, Latin America has led the charge in rejecting the woke revolution.","Bukele Detransitions Gender Theory From El Salvador Public Schools; Milei Calls It ""Political Tool""","Following his comments, El Salvador's Ministry of Education announced that it will stop teaching gender theory to children.

When Kimmel hosts the 96th Oscars on Sunday, he’ll be emceeing the telecast for the fourth time. Only three people — Bob Hope (19 times), Billy Crystal (nine times) and Johnny Carson (five times) — will have hosted more than him.

“It’s an experience that I try to remember is special,” Kimmel said in a recent interview. “I just want to make sure for the people who are watching and the people who are there that we bring the proper amount of respect and also the proper amount of disrespect to the proceedings.”

Kimmel spoke as he prepared for Sunday’s show in between his day job at “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” That includes sifting through possible jokes, posing for photographs he’d rather not and plenty of Oscar discussion around the dinner table, too. Molly McNearney, Kimmel’s wife, is an executive producer on the broadcast.

But Kimmel is by now an old hand at a highly specialized gig. Last year’s broadcast drew 18.7 million viewers, the most since 2020.

“I’m pretty calm,” said Kimmel. “I can’t speak for everyone else.”

The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

AP: Does it irk you that your avowed nemesis Matt Damon is a co-star in the film that appears to be steamrolling to best picture, “Oppenheimer”?

KIMMEL: It delights me. Matt Damon was completely left out of the Oscar festivities. He was even in the movie. It couldn’t be more embarrassing for him. It’s like if everyone in the class got invited to a birthday party, and he’s the one kid who didn't.

AP: How does having two huge films like “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” prominently nominated affect your job?

KIMMEL: It makes it 10 times easier. When nobody has seen the movies — and that has happened, including years when I’ve hosted — you have no point of reference to go from.

AP: You’ve even suggested “Barbie” partially motivated you to host this time.

KIMMEL: It was one of the big contributing factors, knowing that this movie was probably going to get nominated. I felt like I could have some good angles jumping off that. Like our promo was one of them.

AP: This is an election year and war is raging in Ukraine and Gaza. Do you expect to be more political?

KIMMEL: I probably shouldn’t tell you this but I’m going to march all the nominees to the border and we’re going to see if we can’t fix the whole thing on Sunday night. (Laughs) I don’t know. It’s not really the focus of the Oscars. It doesn’t mean I won’t have a joke or two about it. But it’s not really my goal to invoke the name of he-who-shall-not-be-named at the Oscars.

AP: You haven’t been shy on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to take jabs at Donald Trump. He recently called you “a loser.”

KIMMEL: I was going through my records and it seems like only one of us has lost.

AP: For you, what’s the appeal of hosting the Oscars?

KIMMEL: What I do is very fleeting. You do a show and then it’s gone. You don’t have much to show for it because it is so topical. The Oscars have a permanence that’s different for me and it’s fun. However it goes, I’ll always have that. When you watch these montages of 96 years of the Oscars, and to be in it, you have to be pretty jaded for that not to have an effect on you.

AP: You’ve sounded as though you thought you were done. Is that right?

KIMMEL: Oh, absolutely. I never imagined they’d ask me again, really. I was, like, two times, that was good. Maybe it was one of those things where she dumped me and I’ll never date her again. But whatever the case, here I am again for number four.

AP: Does that mean you’re approaching it as if this is the last time?

KIMMEL: It might be. I don’t presume that I’ll be asked to do it again. Looking back on it, it’s always easier to only remember the good things. But I don’t know. I’ll say four seems like a solid number to me.

AP: You’re not interested in remaining a mainstay like Bob Hope?

KIMMEL: The way I look at is: People tend to take you for granted and resent you rather quickly. (Laughs) I’m sure I’ll get some of that this time around. I’ll get the usual, “Can’t they get anyone else to host this thing?” And the answer is, no, they couldn’t.

AP: Have you kept any mementos from your past three times hosting?

KIMMEL: I steal one Oscar every year. Usually from the animated short people. I tell them I need to take it and I’ll get it back to them, and I just never do. They don’t know any better. I have three Oscars now and I’m looking forward to number four.

AP: That’s tough for the animated short people.

KIMMEL: Yeah, well, they’re lucky to be there.

AP: Is there anything you’ve learned about what works and what doesn’t from previous shows?

KIMMEL: I’ve learned that you can put a huge amount of effort into pre-taped comedy bits and get very little response from them. (Laughs) We’ve learned not to do that anymore. Whatever people see on the Oscars that is not an award being handed out they believe is the reason the show is long. That’s not really true, for the most part. A lot of times you have live comedy bits or pre-taped comedy bits just to reset the stage. But I’ve given up on them almost entirely.

AP: One thing we know about Sunday’s show is that Ryan Gosling will be singing “I'm Just Ken.”Do you plan to join him at all in that number?

KIMMEL: No one has asked me to sing. But if I get the call, Oh, yes, I will be center stage belting it out with Ryan.

AP: You were great with him in the Oscar promo.

KIMMEL: It’s a lot harder to look at my face when his is in the same frame. I believe that was my wife’s assessment.

AP: You had the post-slap narrative last year. Is there anything about this year’s crop of movies and nominees that’s interesting to you?

KIMMEL: For me, none of it is particularly interesting. But I like the surprises, you know? Most of these nominees, we don’t know these people, we don’t know what they’re going to say. Some of them we do. Some of them have won 11 awards leading up to this. But the really great moments come from the unexpected winners and people you’ve never heard of. I very much hope that the quality of the speeches comes even close to last year. That’s the difference between a good show and a great show.

AP: How is it going through this experience with your wife, Molly McNearney?

KIMMEL: It’s great. There’s nobody I trust more. That said, we get involved now in a lot more decisions than we were last year. And they’re not all fun decisions. It has its pluses and minuses, for sure. It’s become the topic work-wise in our house pretty much all day, every day for the last two months.

AP: Does your family enjoy you hosting the Oscars?

KIMMEL: A big side storyline is me trying to figure out what my parents are going to wear, how they’re going to get to the show, who’s going to get them backstage after the show. It turns quickly into a family reunion. My older kids will be there with their spouses, some of my cousins, my brother, my sister. There will be a few Kimmels cheering me on in the audience. They look around and then they report back on who was laughing and who wasn’t.

Girl Scouts of the USA said its eastern Missouri chapter had only been following fundraising rules, but that it was “disappointed and disheartened by the tone” of the communication with the troop in St. Louis.

“We felt like we were targeted, unfairly belittled and unheard,” said Nawal Abuhamdeh, a first generation Palestinian Muslim American and the leader of Troop 149 in St. Louis, which has since disbanded from the Girl Scouts.

Tasneem Manjra, a troop leader in California, said it looks like the Girl Scouts are backtracking because they were called out.

“I think that’s a load of Thin Mints,” said Manjra. “They were way too heavy-handed in their response to Nawal and her troop.”

Abuhamdeh said the fundraising effort began because the girls in her troop were uncomfortable selling Girl Scout Cookies while people are starving in Gaza. During one meeting, the girls — who are of Pakistani, Indian, Somali, Syrian, Palestinian and Jordanian heritage — cried and said they felt hopeless.

“What do you think a group of 10-year-old girls would want to do if they felt helpless?"" Abuhamdeh asked during a Zoom meeting promoted by Ceasefire for Kids, which advocates for children in Gaza. ""They would want to help. How do they want to help? They want to make bracelets. They’re 10 years old. That’s what they felt like they could do.”

By mid-January, they were selling bracelets of black, red, white and green beads — the colors of the Palestinian flag — with “Palestine” spelled out in letter blocks.

They were raising money for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, a U.S.-based charity that historically has helped children in need travel to the U.S. for medical treatment. Since the latest war in Gaza began, its focus has shifted to providing food, medication, clothing and humanitarian aid.

Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri sent an email to the troop last month threatening legal action if they continued to sell the bracelets, according to the Missouri chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. That's when the troop disbanded from the national organization.

Abuhamdeh said she is concerned about Girl Scouts’ commitment to “girls like ours.”

“We aspire to be part of an organization that does not only advertise its desired values, but acts on them,” she said.

In response to demands from CAIR, Girl Scouts of the USA said the local chapter followed its rules but mishandled the situation. GSUSA policy stipulates that money raised by Girl Scouts be used for scouting except in “extraordinary circumstances.” In the past, restrictions have been suspended to raise funds to help those suffering because of the Hawaii wildfires and the war in Ukraine.

Restrictions were lifted for three months through Jan. 10 to allow Girl Scouts to raise money for groups supporting people in Gaza, including the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which was approved by a charity assessment organization.

“While the fundraiser in question fell outside of these dates, GSUSA did not consider taking and did not take legal action against this troop or the leader,” the national group said.

It said cookie sale proceeds can always be donated and are never subject to the same restrictions. GSUSA said in 2017 that the organization sells about $800 million in cookies annually.

A petition signed by more than 100 troop leaders demands that Girl Scouts of the USA apologize to Troop 149, issue a statement on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and promise that no other troop will get in trouble for fundraising, Manjra said. If the organization refuses, they will stop selling cookies, she said.

Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri said in a statement this weekend that it had been concerned about maintaining the organization's tax-exempt status. It said it had provided Abuhamdeh with options to continue fundraising, including to modify the language on the bracelet order form to remove the Girl Scout name, or to do the fundraiser on her own.

“We are sorry that Ms. Abuhamdeh chose to disband,” the statement said. “We would welcome them back to the Girl Scout family.”

Abuhamdeh and other scouts questioned the national organization's response, saying they knew nothing about restrictions on fundraising or the moratorium on those limits.

Neither the American Jewish Committee, a prominent advocacy organization, nor the National Jewish Girl Scout Committee have responded to emails from the Associated Press seeking comment.

CAIR said the national organization’s statement was a “positive first step” but that questions persist.

“All these Girl Scouts were trying to do was help the children impacted by the war, just like other troops did for Ukraine,” CAIR’s Missouri board chairman, Yasir Ali, said.

Meanwhile, the controversy has so boosted bracelet orders that the girls suspended sales last week because they couldn’t keep up. Abuhamdeh invited members of the public to help them make bracelets at a mosque on Saturday, and about 100 volunteers showed up.

Thanks to that “solidarity and humanity,” they have raised more than $10,000, Abuhamdeh said.

(AP) — A U.S. Postal Service plan to downsize a regional mail hub in Reno and move package and letter processing to Sacramento, California, already had Nevadans worried Monday about service delays and potential impacts on elections in the key swing state where most voters now cast their ballots by mail.

The blizzard that dumped up to 10 feet (3 meters) of snow on the top of the Sierra, shutting down Interstate 80 and all mountain highways for three days, provided a glimpse of the potential havoc the move could wreak on elections, Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said Monday.

The Democrat who serves as the state's chief election officer and other critics said that under the USPS plan it may not be possible for ballots placed in the mail in central and northern Nevada on Election Day to be postmarked the same day. Aguilar said it “has the potential to disenfranchise thousands of Nevada voters and would unquestionably impact the results of Nevada’s elections.""

“We’ve all seen the footage of semi-trucks caught in the snow ... the kinds of trucks that would be used to ship mail from Reno to Sacramento under the USPS’s recent proposal,"" Aguilar said in a statement. “I can’t fathom how I would explain to my constituents that their mail ballots, or other important mail which could include anything from legal documents to medication, was trapped in the snow in the mountains due to a rushed process and lack of foresight.""

I-80 between Reno and Sacramento reopened Monday to all traffic — with chains still mandatory on most vehicles — for the first time since the storm packing heavy snow and winds gusting well in excess of 100 mph (160 kph) blew into the Sierra on Friday.

Aguilar and others earlier complained about a lack of transparency in what Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has cast as a money-saving move. They said they're concerned that mail service can be snarled traffic delays even in the best of weather by the hourslong roundtrip drive over the Sierra Nevada.

“The USPS standard for local Reno mail received and delivered is two days, a standard which USPS has already struggled to meet,” Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei said in a Wednesday letter to DeJoy. “Sending Nevadans’ mail to California does not seem like a promising way of improving this deficiency.”

The letter accused the Postal Service of failing to show how it shaped its plan or “provide any analysis on local impacts of moving mail processing” from Reno to Sacramento. It sought DeJoy's response by March 15.

Rosen on Friday called reliable on-time mail delivery of medication and Social Security checks crucial for seniors, military veterans and families.

Amodei represents northern Nevada, where mail from a vast eight-county area and the state capital, Carson City, is currently processed and distributed at a Reno facility that would be downsized to a local processing center under a 10-year, $40 billion Postal Service modernization plan to establish 60 regional processing and distribution centers across the U.S.

DeJoy was appointed to his position in May 2020 under Republican President Donald Trump. He faced criticism about sweeping Postal Service policy changes ahead of the November 2020 election and has defended his agency's ability to deliver mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Postal Service spokesman Rod Spurgeon confirmed by email Friday that the agency received the Nevada Congress members' letter and said a response would go directly to them.

""The business case supports transferring some mail processing operations” to Sacramento, the Postal Service said in a Feb. 6 document outlining the Reno office downsizing, which it projected could save up to $4.2 million per year. A period for public comment ended Wednesday. Spurgeon added Friday that findings were preliminary and declined to specify other states where similar plans are being made.

In Wyoming, complaints have arisen among critics who say shifting Postal Service processing from Cheyenne to Denver and from Casper to Billings, Montana, would leave Wyoming without a mail processing facility.

Spurgeon said letters and packages currently processed in Reno would go to Sacramento and be returned to Reno for delivery within the standard two days. The current facility in Reno serves a sprawling Postal Service area home to 22% of Nevada's population. Rural areas vote solidly Republican, while Washoe County and Reno narrowly favored Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020. Other regional postal hubs in Nevada are in Elko and the Las Vegas area.

Washoe County commissioners voted last week to oppose the Post Office downsizing, the Reno Gazette Journal reported, and the interim head of the county elections department told the newspaper she would discourage voters from mailing ballots if the plan becomes final.

“I wouldn’t even put it in the mail,"" interim county Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess said. ""I would drop it off at one of our vote centers.”

Wayne County Sheriff Dean Finch said in a news release that Larry Musgraves Jr., 57, was arrested Friday evening on the ABM Ministries campus in Piedmont, a small town 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of St. Louis. Carmen Musgraves, 64, was arrested around 3 a.m. Saturday when she came to the jail to check on her husband, Finch said.

Both have been charged with first-degree kidnapping and jailed without bond. The Musgraves do not yet have listed attorneys. A phone message was left Monday with ABM Ministries, the latest Christian boarding school in Missouri to face legal scrutiny.

ABM Ministries' website says its facility, operated as Lighthouse Christian Academy, is a private Christian boarding school for boys ages 10-13, situated on 250 acres that include a spring-fed pond and a pasture with animals. On average, it has around 40 students, the website says. The website claims success in helping boys who are troubled, learning-impaired or dealing with ADHD or other disorders.

Finch said that since early January, his office has received reports of five runaways from the school. In one instance, two boys were picked up by a neighboring resident and taken home. The boys asked her to call 911.

But Finch said his investigation began several months ago after he was contacted by a former student living in Alabama. He followed up by interviewing other former students, and eventually the current students.

A probable cause statement says the former student told Finch that on her 18th birthday, she was locked in a small room and ""held against her will."" The statement doesn't specify how long she was allegedly kept in the room.

The sheriff's department “anticipates more charges as the investigation continues, with more alleged victims coming forward,"" the news release stated.

All five boys who had run away since January have been returned to their homes, the Kansas City Star reported.

The school was coed in 2009 when a federal lawsuit accused a former principal of sex acts with a female student and alleged that the Musgraves failed to take action to protect the girl. Court records show that ABM Ministries and the Musgraves agreed to pay $750,000 in a settlement, and the principal agreed to pay $100,000.

In 2023, Agape Boarding School in Stockton, Missouri, closed after years of investigations, lawsuits and eventually criminal charges that followed abuse allegations. One former student alleged he was raped and called “seizure boy” because of his epilepsy. Others said they suffered permanent injuries from being disciplined or forced to work long hours of manual labor.

Allegations of abuse at Agape and at the nearby Circle of Hope Girls’ Ranch prompted a state law in 2021 requiring stricter rules for such facilities. Missouri previously had virtually no oversight for religious boarding schools.

In 2021, Agape’s longtime doctor, David Smock, was charged with child sex crimes and five employees were charged with low-level abuse counts. Those cases are still pending.

Also in 2021, Boyd and Stephanie Householder, former owners of Circle of Hope, were charged with around 100 child abuse counts. They pleaded not guilty and have been scheduled to go to trial in November.

Former students at ABM Ministries said justice was long overdue. Juliana Davis, now 34, said she was abused at the school in 2006 and 2007.

“I'm glad that he took us seriously,"" Davis said of Finch. ""There's a whole group of us that have been trying for decades, speaking out about what happened to us and what we saw.”

Another former student, Aralysa Baker, 31, recalled being put in a chokehold and having her head held underwater when she was a student from 2005 to 2007.

“I never thought in a million years that charges would ever be brought,"" Baker said. “We just wanted the school shut down and the kids sent home.”

Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus pushed the trial, initially scheduled for this month, back to Jan. 13, 2025, because of conflicting schedules, and set a hearing for next month to consider a bid by the defendants to throw out the indictment.

The defendants are state GOP chairman Michael McDonald, national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid, Clark County party chair Jesse Law, Storey County clerk Jim Hindle, national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area.

Each is charged with offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument, felonies that carry penalties of up to four or five years in prison.

Defense attorneys led by McDonald's lawyer, Richard Wright, contend that Nevada state Attorney General Aaron Ford improperly brought the case in Las Vegas instead of Carson City, the state capital, and failed to present evidence to the grand jury that would have exonerated their clients. They also argue there is insufficient evidence and that their clients had no intent to commit a crime.

Trump lost Nevada in 2020 by more than 30,000 votes to Democratic President Joe Biden. The state’s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican whose defense of the results as reliable and accurate led the state GOP to censure her. Cegavske later conducted an investigation that found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.

Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of Republicans falsely certified that Trump, not Biden, had won. Others are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Criminal charges have been brought in Michigan and Georgia. In Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors and two attorneys have settled a lawsuit. In New Mexico, the Democratic attorney general announced last month that five Republicans in his state can’t be prosecuted under current state law.

(AP) — Spreadsheets of raw data associated with every ballot cast are not subject to public scrutiny, a Pennsylvania court ruled Monday in a case that began with a request for the “cast vote records” by an election researcher whose work has fueled right-wing attacks on voting procedures.

Commonwealth Court ruled 5-2 in favor of Secretary of State Al Schmidt, saying that researcher Heather Honey and others were not entitled to the records from Lycoming County for the 2020 General Election.

Pennsylvania’s Elections Code says county election records are public “except the contents of ballot boxes and voting machines and records of assisted voters.” The law does not define voting machines, however.

Honey's October 2021 request under the state's Right-to-Know Law was turned down by the county elections office, a decision upheld by the state Office of Open Records before a Lycoming County judge ruled the public is entitled to the records.

The Commonwealth Court majority ruled Monday that cast vote records are the “electronic, modern-day equivalent” of all the votes in a traditional ballot box and the optical scanners are considered voting machines under state law.

Because Honey did not live and vote in Lycoming County, she was succeeded in the litigation by three Williamsport area residents — a local businessman, a retired state trooper and Republican state Rep. Joe Hamm.

Their lawyer, Thomas Breth, said Monday a decision had not been made about whether to appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

“We respectfully disagree with the majority of the court’s interpretation of the Election Code,” Breth said.

The county judge said in December 2022 that optical scanners used to record Lycoming votes that had been cast on paper ballots did not qualify as voting machines under state law. The judge said that the contents of ballot boxes or voting machines, information that the law shields from public disclosure, amount to the ballots and the mechanisms of voting machines, rather than information contained in those machines such as electronic data.

Judge Ellen Ceisler's majority opinion concluded that Lycoming's optical scanners ""are undoubtedly mechanical, electrical, electromechanical, or electronic components of a voting system that are specifically used for the task of voting, including with regard to the casting and tabulation of votes. Therefore, these devices also fit the generally understood definition of ‘voting machines.’""

She said it would be absurd if the physical ballots were not available for public inspection “but digital analogues of those very same ballots were freely available upon request, as what is special about the ballots is not so much the form which they take, but the voting information which they contain.”

Breth said releasing the data would not enable anyone to pierce the secrecy of ballots.

“The court’s decision, I don’t believe, was based upon any theory that you could reverse engineer the data and identify how somebody voted,"" Breth said.

The Department of State's press office said it was working on a response to the ruling.

In a dissent, Judge Patricia McCullough said the cast vote records don't associate a ballot with a specific voter.

“The order of the numbered list of voters does not even correspond to the order in which ballots are cast,” McCullough wrote. “The only way a person could determine an elector's ordinal position is by personally observing that elector cast his or her ballot.”

Honey, who heads the Lebanon, Pennsylvania-based firm Haystack Investigations, had previously likened the cast vote record to a spreadsheet and described it as “merely a digital report tallying the results of ballots scanned into a tabulator. The CVR is a report that is prepared after an election from a desktop computer that is not and never was the contents of a ballot box.”

Erstwhile Republican candidate J.R. Majewski paused his campaign Saturday, just three days after he had insisted he was staying in the race for Ohio's 9th Congressional District. The about-face was the latest turn in a roller coaster of a GOP primary for the seat long held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur.

Kaptur, 77, who has served in Congress since 1983, is viewed as being among the nation’s most vulnerable House Democrats this year. She beat Majewski by 13 points two years ago.

“It's been a great ride,” Majewski declared on X, formerly known as Twitter, as he left the race and pledged to devote his energy to electing Donald Trump this fall.

Majewski suggested his adversaries were getting ready to resurface reports that arose in 2022 regarding his military service, which would have piled onto new pressure he was facing over remarks he made on a podcast disparaging Special Olympics athletes. Indeed, a new Ohio Truth PAC was planning $373,000 in attack ads against Majewski, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

“J.R. Majewski's decision puts the team first, allowing Republicans to unite and focus on defeating Marcy Kaptur,” Mike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement. “Now, Marcy Kaptur's retirement notice is in the mail.”

Unity isn't quite the word as yet, though. Republican loyalties remain divided between the camps of state Rep. Derek Merrin, a latecomer to the contest backed by U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, and former state Rep. Craig Riedel, who still enjoys the backing of pro-Trump U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan and other key area Republicans.

Merrin was recruited after comments came to light where Riedel criticized Trump as “arrogant” and said he may not endorse him. This was seen as highly damaging in a state that has twice strongly supported Trump for president, though Riedel more recently took steps to advance himself as a Trump supporter. The faceoff was among those Johnson discussed with Trump during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in February.

Both Merrin and Riedel are viewed by party leadership as more viable than Majewski against Kaptur in a general election match-up. Still, the lateness of Majewski's departure from the contest complicates matters.

Early voting in Ohio has been underway for weeks in what is shaping up to be a low-turnout election. Majewski had amassed significant conservative star power that he said positioned him as a frontrunner. That included endorsements from Trump-backed U.S. Sen. JD Vance, Gen. Michael Flynn, Rep. Matt Gaetz and former presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy.

As of Monday, his name remained on ballots and, according to the Lucas County Board of Elections, Majewski had not yet filed paperwork to withdraw his candidacy. He has already entered and exited the race twice, raising questions over whether this decision is final.

Besides Riedel and Merrin, former Mayor Steve Lankenau is also competing for the nomination.

John Thune is entering the race to be the next Republican leader of the U.S. Senate once Sen. Mitch McConnell steps away from the post in November.

Thune, currently the No. 2 Senate Republican, told local news outlets that he is interested in the job. He said in an interview with South Dakota's Keloland News that “I hope to be” the next leader and will do everything he can to convince his colleagues to support him.

He told another local news outlet, Dakota News Now, that McConnell stepping down is “a chance for a reset and I’d like to be a part of it.”

His announcement sets up an expected race with Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who held the No. 2 leadership post until he was term-limited five years ago. The two men have long hinted at their interest in replacing McConnell, but they have made their campaigns official in light of McConnell’s announcement last week that he would not seek reelection as GOP leader when his term ends in November.

Other senators could jump into the race as well, including Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who is currently No. 3 in leadership behind McConnell and Thune.

Republican senators haven’t chosen a new leader since 2007, when McConnell was elected — before most current GOP senators took office. Much of the campaigning will likely take place in private and in one-on-one meetings, as the contenders work to convince each of their GOP colleagues to back them on a secret ballot. The election will take place in a closed-door conference meeting at some point after the November elections.

Thune has at times sparred with former President Donald Trump, the current front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination. In the days before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Thune told reporters that Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat would “go down like a shot dog” in the Senate.

Since then, Trump declined to endorse Thune’s reelection bid in 2022 and Thune endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott over Trump in the presidential primary. But after Scott dropped out and it has become more likely that Trump will be the party's nominee this year, Thune has said he would back the former president.

Thune told Dakota News Now that Trump “has taken some swipes” but “I just think in the end, I worked with him well when he was president before.”

The four-term senator mulled retirement in 2022 but ultimately decided to come back to the Senate as it became clear he had a chance to become leader.

Like Cornyn, Thune said he would work to make sure individual senators have more of a voice in decisions. That has been a frequent complaint from rank-and-file members under McConnell, particularly as massive year-end spending bills that are introduced by leadership and quickly passed through both chambers have become more common.

Announcing his intention to run on Friday, Cornyn said he believes “the Senate is broken — that is not news to anyone.”

It is so far unclear who will have an advantage in the race. Thune could have the advantage of incumbency as McConnell’s current deputy. But Barrasso has tracked furthest to the right of the three, becoming the first of them to endorse former President Donald Trump for the GOP presidential nomination.

Cornyn has drawn attention for his fundraising, having raised a total of $13 million for incumbents, the party’s Senate campaign arm and Senate Republican nominees already in the 2024 cycle.

But Thune has amassed a campaign war chest of $17.8 million — a sum that he is also likely to use as campaign contributions to fellow Republicans as he mounts the bid for leader.

While McConnell still enjoys support from the majority of his caucus, he announced his plan to step aside last week after facing louder and increasing criticism from some within his party who have said it is time for a change in leadership.

McConnell was also at odds with Trump, whom he has said was “ practically and morally responsible ” for the Capitol attack. The two haven’t spoken since before then, and Trump frequently bashes him publicly.

“Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time,” McConnell said in a floor speech last week. “I have many faults, misunderstanding politics is not one of them.”

Kenneth Espinoza was arrested after he stopped to wait for his son when he was pulled over in Trinidad, Colorado, on Nov. 29, 2022. Espinoza, who had been following his son to a car appointment, was first told he had to move his truck. But after he started to leave, he was ordered to stay. Las Animas County Sheriff's Deputy Mikhail Noel pulled his gun, then took out his Taser, according to an independent investigation.

Noel, then Lt. Henry Trujillo used their Tasers on Espinoza. The Las Animas County Sheriff's Office confirmed in September they were both fired after an investigation by the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office found they had violated a number of agency policies, including inappropriately using a Taser against Espinoza and inaccurately reporting what happened.

Las Animas County Sheriff Derek Navarette did not immediately respond to a telephone call or email seeking comment Monday on the settlement.

Trujillo declined to comment. A telephone number could not be found for Noel.

The outside investigation found Espinoza did not attempt to strike Noel with his truck and “at no time does Mr. Espinoza actively use any force against Lt. Trujillo or Dep. Noel,” Las Animas County Undersheriff Reynaldo Santistevan wrote in an Aug. 10 letter to the sheriff. He recommended both deputies be fired after reviewing body camera footage and the investigative report.

Santistevan added that at “no time did either try to de-escalate this matter, but only made it worse.”

Santistevan acknowledged that he did not watch the body camera footage of the incident before reviewing and signing off on the officers' accounts of what happened.

Espinoza's lawsuit, filed in May, alleges that Noel used a Taser to stun him.

Body camera video then shows Espinoza being pulled from the truck, handcuffed and squeezed into the back of a patrol car.

As the deputies struggle to get Espinoza into the car, video shows, one warns that he is going to use the Taser on him, and uses an expletive.

One device can be seen contacting Espinoza’s body along with the wires that carry Taser electrodes, as crackling sounds are heard.

One of Espinoza's attorneys, Kevin Mehr, said in a statement that the settlement is a victory for the people of Colorado and “sends a clear message to thugs like this who think a badge is a license for brutality.”

The White House said the change aligns its policies with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The agency last week relaxed its recommendation that those who test positive for COVID-19 isolate for five days. Now, the agency says people can return to work or regular activities if their symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since they’ve had a fever.

The White House testing protocol was instituted shortly after the pandemic began in 2020 when former President Donald Trump was in the White House. It was further strengthened by Biden's administration when he took office amid the pandemic in January 2021.

Both Trump and Biden contracted the virus while in office. Trump required hospitalization after falling seriously ill weeks before the 2020 presidential election; Biden had minimal symptoms after catching it in the summer of 2022 after having been vaccinated.

More than 1.18 million people in the U.S. died from COVID-19, according to CDC data and 6.85 million were hospitalized over the past four years. More than 270 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. The vaccines have helped dramatically reduce instances of serious disease and death since their widespread availability in early 2021.

Up to A$20 Million Equity Raising

Sydney, Mar 12, 2024 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Lake Resources NL ( ASX:LKE ) ( LK1:FRA ) ( LLKKF:OTCMKTS ) is pleased to announce that it has received firm commitments for an approximately A$15 million institutional placement (""Placement"") through the issue of approximately 213.6 million new fully ordinary shares (""New Shares"") at an offer price of A$0.07 per New Share (""Offer Price"").



Highlights



- Strong support received from offshore and domestic institutional and sophisticated investors leading to introduction of new high-quality investors to Lake's register



- In addition to the Placement, Lake will offer all eligible shareholders the opportunity to participate in a SPP to raise up to approximately A$5 million at the same price as the Placement



- Funds will be used for working capital to extend runway, in addition to the recently announced cost saving measures, until the completion of the strategic partnership process



- Upon settlement of the Placement, Lake will have a strong pro-forma 31 December 2023 cash balance of A$46.3 million to advance the strategic partnership process for Kachi



In addition to the Placement, Lake will also be undertaking a Share Purchase Plan (""SPP"") at the same price as the Placement, to raise up to A$5 million. The Placement and SPP (together the ""Offer"") will raise total gross proceeds of up to approximately A$20 million.



The Offer enhances Lake's balance sheet by providing additional working capital and financial flexibility during the strategic partnership selection process for Kachi. Lake is actively conducting outreach to a wide array of potential strategic partners including car and battery manufacturers, lithium producers, oil and gas companies, sovereign wealth funds and private equity. The strategic partnership process is scheduled to conclude in the second half of the year (2H CY24).



Commenting on the Offer, Lake's CEO, David Dickson said: ""We are pleased with the level of support shown for Lake from both existing and new shareholders. The equity raising will provide funding capacity to support the delivery of the strategic partnership process. We are pleased to offer our existing retail shareholders the ability to participate in the capital raising via the SPP.""



Placement



Under the Placement, the Company will issue approx. 213.6 million fully paid ordinary shares in the Company, representing approximately 15% of issued capital, at A$0.07 per New Share, raising a total of A$15 million (before costs), to institutional, sophisticated and professional investors.



The issue price of A$0.07 per share, represents a 39.1% discount to the last closing price of A$0.115 on 8 March 2024 and a 42.3% discount to the 5-day VWAP of A$0.121 as at the same date.



The New Shares will be issued under the Company's existing placement capacity under ASX Listing Rules 7.1. The Placement is not underwritten.



Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited and Canaccord Genuity (Australia) Limited acted as Joint Lead Managers and Bookrunners to the Placement. Morgans Corporate Limited is acting as Co-Manager to the Placement.



Share Purchase Plan



In addition to the Placement, the Company will offer all eligible existing shareholders with a registered address in Australia or New Zealand who were holders of Lake shares at 7:00pm (AEDT) on Monday, 11 March 2024 (""Record Date"") (""Eligible Shareholders""), the opportunity to apply for new Lake shares, at the same issue price and same terms and conditions as the Placement. The issue price will be $0.07 per share.



Lake intends to raise up to A$5 million and retains discretion over the allocation of shares per investor. The SPP will allow Eligible Shareholders to apply for the maximum allowed of A$30,000 of new fully paid ordinary shares, per shareholder, recognising the ongoing value and support of Lake's shareholders.



The SPP is not underwritten. An SPP booklet containing further terms and conditions of the SPP is expected to be provided to Eligible Shareholders on the 18 th of March.



Lake intends to apply for a waiver under ASX Listing Rule 7.1 as a consequence of the issue price of shares under the SPP being less than 80% of the 5-day VWAP prior to the date of this announcement. If the ASX does not grant this waiver, the SPP will not be exempt from the Company's placement capacity calculation, and therefore the SPP may require shareholder approval at an EGM. If so, the indicative timetable below will be affected accordingly.

The court did not respond to a Reuters inquiry on the number of lawsuits dismissed.

Vale said it was not involved in Schvartsman's appeal for the lawsuits' suspension. His defense said in a statement that the decision recognizes the non-existence of any act or omission by him with any causal link with the dam collapse.

A tailings dam at a Vale iron ore mine in the city of Brumadinho, located in Minas Gerais, collapsed in early 2019, killing 270 people, while also damaging homes, forests and rivers.

The court said new cases against Schvartsman over Brumadinho case can be filed by prosecutors.

Criminal lawsuits against another fifteen people were not affected by Wednesday's decision, it added, as it only encompass Schvartsman's case.

With the election in full swing, it's time to “put some foots down on election-related stuff for a bit,” Midjourney CEO David Holz told several hundred members of the service's devoted userbase in a digital office hours event Wednesday.

Declaring that ""this moderation stuff is kind of hard,” Holz didn't outline exactly what policy changes were being made but described the clampdown as a temporary measure to make it harder for people to abuse the tool. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Attempts by AP journalists to test Midjourney's new policy on Wednesday by asking it to make an image of “Trump and Biden shaking hands at the beach” led to a “Banned Prompt Detected” warning. A second attempt escalated the warning to: “You have triggered an abuse alert.”

The tiny company — which has just 11 employees, according to its website — has largely kept silent in the public debate over how generative AI tools could fuel election misinformation around the world. Midjourney was the only maker of a leading image-generating tool that didn't join a voluntary tech industry pact in February to combat AI-generated deepfakes that deliberately trick voters.

“I don’t really care about political speech,” Holz said Wednesday. “That’s not the purpose of Midjourney. It’s not that interesting to me. That said, I also don’t want to spend all of my time trying to police political speech. So we’re going to have put our foot down on it a bit.”

The Center for Countering Digital Hate released a report earlier this month that concluded Midjourney is already being used to produce images that could support disinformation about political candidates or false claims of election fraud.

“Midjourney seemed to have the fewest controls of any AI image-generator when it came to generating images of well-known political figures like Joe Biden and Donald Trump,"" said Callum Hood, the group's head of research, in an interview Wednesday. “Midjourney was almost unique in both being willing to generate those images and generating quite convincing images of candidates.”

The watchdog group tested Midjourney as well as OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus, Stability AI’s DreamStudio and Microsoft’s Image Creator, and found all had problems, creating election disinformation in 41% of cases. But “Midjourney performed worst of any tool, failing in 65% of test runs,” the report said.

Hood said he wasn't aware if Midjourney changed its policies this week but “its decision to block those images would help seal a major weakness compared to other popular image generators.”

As recently as late last week, Midjourney's public database shows users were successfully able to produce images based on prompts such as “Abstract photo of Donald Trump sitting in a tiny electric car” and “joe biden eating ice cream.”

But that changed in recent days as users reported they received a warning when trying to make Biden or Trump images. Some complained that Midjourney wasn't properly communicating the changed policy.

Midjourney differs from other image-generators in that it is possible for users to see most other users' written prompts and images because it all happens in public forums on the social media platform Discord. Midjourney’s Discord group has more than 19 million members, the largest of any group on the chatting platform. It's where Holz holds his weekly office hours, which can veer into wide-ranging conversations about AI and the future of humanity.

“Anybody who’s scared about fake images in 2024 is going to have a hard 2028,” Holz said Wednesday. “It will be a very different world at that point. Like, obviously you’re still going to have humans running for president in 2028, but they won’t be purely human anymore.”

All the candidates at that time will have real-looking “deepfake chatbots” with simulated talking points, he said. Holz warned Wednesday that people who really want to make deepfakes will find alternatives that “can be fine tuned on specific people and will work better than our systems.”

Based near San Francisco and founded in 2020, the company describes itself as an “independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.” It first unveiled the public version of its image-generator in July 2022. That — and the release of a key rival, Stable Diffusion, later that summer — sparked growing fascination with generative AI technology that intensified with the debut of ChatGPT several months later.

Holz told The Associated Press later that year that Midjourney works to ban offensive and harmful content, usually by blocking certain keywords and having its team of moderators track outputs and respond to complaints from other users.

“We really try to let people make the broadest set of images possible but we do ban people every day from the service,” Holz said in late 2022.

(AP) — A federal trial over North Carolina's photo voter identification law remains set for May after a judge refused Wednesday to end efforts by civil rights groups that sued over the requirement on allegations that its provisions are marred by racial bias.

U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs denied a “summary judgment” motion filed 2 1/2 years ago for members of the State Board of Elections, which is implementing the 2018 ID law enacted by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. After legal delays in state and federal courts, the photo ID requirement under that law began with municipal elections last fall and the March 5 primaries.

Attorneys for GOP legislative leaders also defending the law had told Biggs that they supported the board's motion, which if granted would have meant the law's defenders would have prevailed without additional evidence or testimony. A trial is scheduled to begin May 6.

The state NAACP and several local chapters contend that the photo ID mandate, along with other provisions in the law, violate the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act by discriminating disproportionately against Black and Latino residents trying to vote.

State attorneys for the elections board wrote in their 2021 motion that the NAACP's evidence doesn't show discriminatory intent by the legislature, and that burdens imposed on voters who lacked ID are “extremely limited.” Compared to a 2013 voter ID law that was struck down, the 2018 law expands the number of qualifying IDs.

Biggs wrote she was denying the board's motion in part because “genuine disputes"" over the facts in the case are present, and otherwise the legal parties “dispute the inferences which may reasonably be drawn from key undisputed facts.”

In late 2019, Biggs had issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law, saying it was tainted because the 2013 law had been struck down on similar grounds of racial bias. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed her decision, writing that Biggs had put too much emphasis on the past conduct of the General Assembly when evaluating the 2018 law.

On Wednesday, Biggs mentioned the reversal but said the defendants weren't necessarily entitled to a favorable ruling now because the standards for summary judgment are different. Any appeal of summary judgment decisions usually can happen after a trial.

Previous trial dates for the case have been postponed — once when the U.S. Supreme Court weighed Biggs' earlier refusal to allow GOP lawmakers to join the case and defend the law in court. The U.S. justices sided with the legislative leaders in 2022.

Biggs opened the door to move this case along last summer after the state Supreme Court determined the photo ID law comported with state constitution.

The passing of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has sparked discussions surrounding Canada’s involvement in the fight against South African Apartheid. Many headlines and articles have hailed Canada, with Mulroney taking a starring role, as a leading force against apartheid. From the reports and the reminiscences of ordinary folk (raised not to speak ill of the dead), you get a picture of Mulroney leading the charge with the Canadian flag as his standard, riding to the rescue of Nelson Mandela, and tilting his lance at the evil apartheid regime. But a closer examination reveals a more nuanced and less flattering reality.

While some tout Canada’s leadership in the anti-apartheid movement, the truth paints a different picture. In fact, Canada’s historical actions were mostly aligned with support for apartheid in South Africa. In fact, Canada provided a model for apartheid policies, with South Africa drawing inspiration from Canada’s treatment of First Nations peoples. So much so that South African officials visited a number of “Indian reserves”, and residential schools to learn the secrets of a “successful” settler state.

However, Canada’s public stance against apartheid often contradicted its actions. While there were moments of symbolic opposition, such as John Diefenbaker’s call for South Africa’s expulsion from the British Commonwealth in 1961, these gestures were more about political expediency than moral conviction. Diefenbaker’s motives were primarily to salvage the Commonwealth, fearing the departure of other former British colonies if South Africa remained. This lack of principled opposition was evident in Canada’s refusal to cancel trade agreements with South Africa, dating back to 1932.

During Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment in the 1960s, Canadian political leaders failed to advocate strongly for his release. NDP leader Tommy Douglas raised the issue in the House of Commons, but Prime Minister Lester Pearson remained largely silent on Mandela’s plight. This indifference reflected Canada’s broader sympathy towards the apartheid regime over the Black liberation movement.

Pierre Trudeau’s government, often seen as progressive internationally, maintained a pragmatic approach that favored economic interests over human rights. Canadian companies continued to invest in South Africa, benefiting from cheap black labor. Trudeau’s government even supported South Africa’s application for a billion-dollar IMF credit in 1982, despite widespread opposition from other nations and within the IMF itself.

While officially endorsing the international arms embargo against South Africa, Canada’s enforcement was lax. Canadian-made weapons found their way to the apartheid regime, with Crown company Canadair selling amphibious water bombers used for internal security operations. Additionally, the RCMP provided training to South African police, raising questions about Canada’s complicity in apartheid-era repression.

Despite mounting pressure from various sectors, including unions, churches, and students, it wasn’t until Brian Mulroney’s Conservative government in 1986 that Canada finally implemented economic sanctions against South Africa. However, Mulroney, who was prime minister from 1984 to 1993, was hardly at the brave knight leading the charge. The fact is that nations like Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, Brazil, and Argentina had already severed ties with South Africa, and the United States had enacted stricter sanctions. Furthermore, from October 1986 to September 1993, Canada’s bilateral trade with South Africa totaled $1.6 billion; not much of a change from the previous six-year period.

Canada’s relationship with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading anti-apartheid organization, was ambivalent to say the least. Ottawa initially resisted recognizing the ANC and sought to influence its direction towards more moderate policies, aligned with international capital and the interest of White South African elites. Yes, apartheid must end, but the “Black communists” must not get their hands on the economic levers of a “New South Africa”.

Overall, Canada’s role in opposing apartheid in South Africa was far from exemplary. While there were moments of symbolic condemnation and eventual economic sanctions, these actions often came late and were overshadowed by ongoing economic ties and political pragmatism.

Canada’s legacy in the fight against apartheid is one of mixed motives and tepid commitment, with the true champions of change emerging from grassroots solidarity movements rather than governmental initiatives.

(AP) — The Delaware attorney general’s office has determined that a police officer was justified in using deadly force last year against a man who drove his vehicle toward him while trying to avoid an arrest for dealing drugs.

In a report released Wednesday, authorities said New Castle County Police Corporal Corey Nicholson acted in self-defense and the defense of others when he shot Andrew Edelemann, 22. A passenger in Edelmann’s vehicle, Aida Pabon, was wounded in the leg.

“Corporal Nicholson’s use of deadly force was a justified and reasonable response to the real threat of death or serious physical injury posed to him and his fellow officers by the actions of Edelmann,” investigators wrote.

“Any subjective perceptions of harm became objective facts when Edelmann nearly ran over Corporal Nicholson with a Hyundai SUV and struck two police vehicles in a matter of seconds,” they added.

Edelmann was shot after an undercover police officer arranged on Instagram to buy two chocolate bars infused with psychedelic mushrooms from Edelmann for $50 each. The two agreed to meet in the parking lot of a 7-11 store on Maryland Avenue in Wilmington.

In preparing to arrest Edelmann, New Castle County police developed a plan for an officer in an undercover pickup truck to position his vehicle in front of Edelmann’s so he could not flee the scene. Nicholson was in the front passenger seat of the truck, and the undercover officer who arranged the buy was in the back seat.

When police arrived, Edelmann’s vehicle was backed into a handicap parking spot. Several police vehicles converged on the scene, but the officer in the truck was unable to entirely block Edelmann’s vehicle, leaving a gap of several feet.

Nicholson, wearing a police uniform, exited the truck with his gun drawn and immediately began shouting commands at Edelmann, standing directly in the path of Edelmann’s vehicle, according to the report. Investigators said Edelmann accelerated his SUV in an apparent attempt to flee.

“Corporal Nicholson stated that Edelmann’s facial expression gave him the impression that Edelmann was “not going to give up – deer in headlights face,” investigators wrote. Store surveillance footage and police body camera footage show that Nicholson was directly in front of Edelmann’s vehicle, and that Nicholson “was barely able to avoid getting hit as he fired his weapon at the vehicle,” according to investigators.

Nicholson fired eight shots. Edelmann was struck by five rounds, while Pabon was hit in the left knee. A loaded AR-style semiautomatic rifle was found on the driver’s side of Edelmann’s vehicle.

Edelmann’s family, along with Pabon, are suing Nicholson and the county in federal court. Court records indicate that they plan to file an amended complaint following a judge’s ruling last month on the county’s request to dismiss several claims in the lawsuit.

Brian Kemp for his signature.

Senators voted 33-21 along party lines to approve changes that the House made last week to Senate Bill 233. House approval had long eluded the state's school choice advocates.

Whereas last year a defeat of the bill in the House left Democratic opponents jubilant, supporters broke into applause and embraced as the Senate approved the measure, marking the end of a multiyear saga to create a third Georgia program funding nonpublic education options.

“When I cheer today, I’m going to be cheering because more parents and more families will have more opportunities,"" said state Sen. Greg Dolezal, a Republican from Cumming who sponsored the bill.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp backs the voucher plan, including devoting a substantial portion of his State of the State speech to advocating for it.

“I firmly believe we can take an all-of-the-above approach to education options,” Kemp said in a statement Wednesday.

Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington began to forcefully advocate for the bill, persuading seven Republicans and a Democrat who opposed the measure last year to support it, providing the narrow margin of victory in the House.

The bill would provide $6,500 education savings accounts to students attending public schools that rank in Georgia’s bottom 25% for academic achievement. That money could be spent on private school tuition, home schooling supplies, therapy, tutoring or even early college courses for high school students.

It differs from last year’s failed measure, having been combined with a number of other education initiatives. But opponents argued that it would subtract resources from public schools, with school districts losing state aid as children depart, even as other students will remain behind.

“This bill is a thinly veiled effort to segregate and discriminate under the guise of choice,"" said Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Democrat from Duluth. ""Private institutions free to pick their students will inevitably leave behind those who perhaps need the most support -– our special needs students, our struggling learners.”

The new program would be limited to spending 1% of the $14.1 billion that Georgia spends on its school funding formula, or $141 million. Lawmakers would appropriate money for the voucher separately, and not take it directly out of the formula. That could provide more than 21,000 scholarships. Students who could accept them are supposed to have attended an eligible public school for at least two consecutive semesters, or be about to enter kindergarten at an eligible public school.

Students from households with incomes of less than four times the federal poverty level would be prioritized for the scholarships. Four times the federal poverty level is about $100,000 for a family of three.

Parents would have to provide proof of allowed expenditures to a new Georgia Education Savings Authority to claim the money. All of a family’s eligible children could qualify for the program

Democrats argue the money isn’t enough to pay tuition at most private schools, and that private schools aren’t available in some rural areas. They also say private schools don’t have to accept all applicants and could discriminate against people with differing social and religious views

“The reality is that a $6,500 voucher here doesn’t go nearly far enough to afford any kind of quality education,"" said Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat.

Republicans, though, say that amount could make a difference for many families.

“Don’t tell these parents that this $6,500 bridge can’t change the lives of their kids, because it can,"" Dolezal said.

Democrats also question whether the voucher will violate the Georgia Constitution's ban on giving money to religious institutions. “It appears to me to be a little unconstitutional,"" said Sen. Derek Mallow of Savannah.

The Georgia effort is part of a nationwide GOP wave favoring education savings accounts following the COVID-19 pandemic and fights over what children should learn in public schools.

Other parts of the revamped bill include writing current teacher pay raises into Georgia’s K-12 school funding formula, letting public school prekindergarten programs qualify for state aid to construct and furnish buildings, letting students enroll in other public school districts that will accept them and increasing tax credits for donations to public schools.

The language on teacher raises is partly symbolic — lawmakers have been increasing pay using budget bills in recent years.

Georgia already gives vouchers for special education students in private schools and $120 million a year in income tax credits for donors to private school scholarship funds.

John Ball Zoo celebrates its opening day of 133rd season

The zoo opened Friday for its 133rd season, bringing in new animals and exciting events centered around supporting the conservation of wildlife and wild places.

“We are very excited to welcome the community back to the zoo for the 2024 season,” JBZ CEO Peter D’Arienzo said. “We hope families can create lasting memories and learn about conservation during their visit and engage with our new zoo residents and events. There is so much to look forward to this year.”

The zoo’s chimpanzee troop gained a new member, Zuhura, which means “morning star.”

FOX 17

The 10-year-old chimpanzee came to John Ball Zoo from the Detroit Zoo – a move recommended by experts at the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to benefit Zu’s social needs, as well as those of JBZ’s troop.

“She came as a ten-year-old chimp and, as a female…in the wild, they would kind of start looking for a new troop, so this is kind of a natural move for her,” zookeeper Tyler Stinchcomb explained. “We welcome her here, and she’s doing really well with our troop.”

FOX 17

“She’s a really social and really curious chimp. So, right now, like, she is really interested in people and interested in what we’re doing,” Stinchcomb said about Zu. “She’s big into the others that we have, too. So, she’s gonna be the chimp – if you ever see chimps grooming each other – ZuZu will probably be in the mix grooming.”

The zoo also welcome four male Chacoan peccaries, a pig-like endangered species native to the Gran Chaco, a hot and dry plain in Paraguay.

John Ball Zoo additionally welcomed back Titan, an Amur tiger from Toledo Zoo, at the recommendation of AZA.

Titan will be part of a breeding pair.

Plus, John Ball Zoo welcomed three San Clemente Island goats to the improved Red’s Hobby Farm.

The zoo completed the renovations during the off-season to make the space a more dynamic environment for the animals, including new climbing structures for animal enrichment and extended fencing to give Pumpkin, the Dwarf Highland cow, more room.

New this season, John Ball Zoo will feature Wild Explorer – an educational experience that uses fully immersive virtual reality technology so guests can get closer than ever to gorillas in the jungle and understand them in their natural habitats.

This experience features a 360-degree, live action film with motion platform seating, and will stay at the zoo for a minimum of three years.

The former Borussia Dortmund boss is calling an end to his Reds career in the summer after a wonderful nine year spell on Merseyside which has saw him win every major trophy possible.

He’s already added a second Carabao Cup to his collection this season with Liverpool also in contention for the Premier League and Europa League during the final months of the campaign.

Aguero won five league titles during his time with Manchester City but that hasn’t stopped him from expressing his admiration for Klopp.

“Terrific manager, Klopp has certainly elevated Liverpool, allowing them to become a protagonist of the Premier League in recent years,” Aguero told Stake.com (via Liverpool Echo). “He’s made them more aggressive, more intense in their playing style.

“New players have arrived and Jurgen has managed to adapt them to this offensive mentality. He’ll be sorely missed in the Premier League, but he’s made his choice, and it’s up to us to respect it.

“Any great manager will teach you many valuable things. It would have been a great experience for sure [to play under Klopp].”

The Argentine played under Pep Guardiola for the majority of his time at the Etihad but Aguero’s comments prove just how much respect top class players have for Klopp and what he’s done.

He’s achieved so much success on a much tighter budget compared to the current City boss and it’s going to be hard for anyone to come in and continue the excellent work the German has done at Anfield.

He’s completed some brilliant transfer business down the years at Liverpool and also brought in three quality additions in the summer which means whoever does become our next manager they’ll be inheriting a hungry squad full of quality.

Who knows how much more success we could’ve tasted had Aguero plied his trade in the Premier League in a Liverpool shirt rather than a City one but as the 35-year-old says – Klopp will be seriously missed.

(AP) — Convicted killer Alex Murdaugh didn't tell the truth when FBI agents repeatedly asked him where more than $6 million he stole ended up and whether another attorney not yet identified helped him steal from clients and his law firm, federal prosecutors said in court documents Tuesday.

The prosecutors want a judge to revoke their end of a plea deal with Murdaugh on theft and other charges and order him to the maximum of well over 100 years in prison when he is sentenced in Charleston, South Carolina, on Monday.

Murdaugh, 55, is already serving life without parole in state prison after a jury found him guilty of murder in the shootings of his wife and younger son. He pleaded guilty to stealing money from clients and his law firm in state court and was sentenced to 27 years, which South Carolina prosecutors said is an insurance policy to keep him behind bars in case his murder conviction was ever overturned.

The federal case was supposed to be even more insurance, with whatever sentence Murdaugh received running at the same time as his state sentences. But that deal is in doubt after the FBI said the disbarred attorney failed a polygraph.

The test came in October, after three previous FBI interviews of Murdaugh led investigators to think he wasn't telling the full truth about where at least $6 million he stole ended up and the role of an attorney who has not been publicly identified in his crimes, federal prosecutors said.

In court papers, prosecutors asked to keep the report on the polygraph test and summaries of Murdaugh's four FBI interviews from the public, saying a grand jury is continuing to investigate and the information could be used to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

Murdaugh's attorneys didn't respond to messages Tuesday. They have not filed a response in court, although a footnote in the prosecution's filing said they were against keeping the polygraph report secret.

Federal prosecutors said Murdaugh did appear to tell the truth about the roles banker Russell Laffitte and attorney and old college friend Cory Fleming played in helping him steal.

Laffitte was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison, while Fleming is serving nearly four years behind bars after pleading guilty.

Each of the 22 counts Murdaugh pleaded guilty to in federal court carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. Some carry a 30-year maximum. Prosecutors said they will ask for the stiffest sentence possible since the plea agreement was breached and require Murdaugh serve his federal sentence at the end of any state sentences.

They said there is a long history of federal law that won't allow Murdaugh to revoke his guilty plea since he broke the terms of the deal.

State prosecutors estimated Murdaugh stole more than $12 million from clients by diverting settlement money into his own accounts or stealing from his family law firm. Federal investigators estimate at least $6 million of that has not been accounted for, although Murdaugh has said he spent extravagantly on illegal drugs after becoming hooked on opioids.

Investigators said that as Murdaugh's schemes were about to be exposed in June 2021, he decided to kill his wife and son. Paul Murdaugh was shot several times with a shotgun and Maggie Murdaugh was shot several times with a rifle outside the family's home in Colleton County.

Murdaugh has adamantly denied killing them, even testifying in his own defense against his lawyers' advice.

As he pleaded guilty in federal court on Sept. 21, it was the first time he admitted to a crime and promised to stick to the requirements of his deal, including being “fully truthful and forthright with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies by providing full, complete and truthful information about all criminal activities about which he/she has knowledge.”

“I want to take responsibility. I want my son to see me take responsibility. It’s my hope that by taking responsibility that the people I’ve hurt can begin to heal,” said Murdaugh, standing in his orange South Carolina prison jumpsuit.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova's Constitutional Court on Tuesday struck down legislation aimed at barring from elections a banned party linked to a fugitive business magnate who supports opponents of the pro-European government.

The court ruled unconstitutional an amendment to the former Soviet state's electoral law barring individuals linked to parties deemed illegal or unconstitutional from running for office for three years.

The measure, passed last year, was part of a concerted drive by authorities against pro-Russian businessman Ilan Shor.

Shor was sentenced to 15 years in prison in absentia last year for fraud in connection with the ""theft of the century"", the disappearance of $1 billion from Moldova's banking system in 2014-2015.

A party bearing his name was ruled unconstitutional and the amendment was invoked to keep its members out of local elections last year, including one of Shor's deputies running for mayor in Balti, Moldova's second largest city.

Shor has organised noisy street protests against President Maia Sandu from exile in Israel and denounced the president's campaign to secure European Union membership for the country lying between Ukraine and Romania. Sandu accuses him of trying to undermine Moldova's institutions with Russian help.

Parliamentary speaker Igor Grosu said the government would abide by the ruling, but make every effort to prevent anyone linked to criminal organisations from running for office.

""We will make adjustments in accordance with the court's ruling, but will not allow criminal groups to seize control of the electoral process and undermine democracy in Moldova,"" Grosu said in comments broadcast on television.

Moldova has long unsuccessfully sought Shor's extradition.

Sandu identifies Russia as the single biggest threat to the sovereignty of Moldova and has called for a referendum later this year to secure a public mandate for her drive to join the EU. The Constitutional Court last week cleared the way for the vote to be held at the same time as a presidential election.

Moldova faces twin threats to its stability from the separatist enclave of Transdniestria in the east and the region of Gagauzia in the south, whose leader has close links to Shor.

Both regions have in recent weeks sought support from Russia.

(AP) — Days after Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey blamed an after-school fight on a school district's diversity programming, a lawyer for the majority Black district in suburban St. Louis said that the state's chief attorney is showing “obvious racial bias.""

Bailey, who is campaigning to keep his seat, said last week that he is investigating possible violations of the state’s human rights laws by the Hazelwood School District, after a March 8 fight left a girl hospitalized with severe head injuries.

Bailey blamed the school district’s diversity, equity and inclusion programming as a cause for the fight, which St. Louis County police say happened after school hours in a neighborhood about two blocks from Hazelwood East High School. He said were it not for the programs, a school resource officer would have been present at the school.

“I am launching an investigation into Hazelwood School District after a student was senselessly assaulted by another student in broad daylight,” Bailey said in a statement. “The entire community deserves answers on how Hazelwood’s radical DEI programs resulted in such despicable safety failures that has resulted in a student fighting for her life.”

Hazelwood School District lawyer Cindy Reeds Ormsby said in a Tuesday letter to Bailey that his “obvious racial bias against majority minority school districts is clear.”

“Do you honestly believe, again, without any official verification or specific knowledge, that the fight on March 8th was a result of a racial issue between the female students that was caused by the HSD belief in the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion for all?” Ormsby wrote. “What community do you represent as the Missouri Attorney General? Do you represent all citizens of Missouri? Or only the white citizens?”

Ormsby also questioned Bailey’s interest in the Hazelwood assault, but not several other cases of violence against students from nearby districts.

Hazelwood School District is about 95% Black and less than 2% white, according to state education department data. The races of the victim and a 15-year-old girl who was arrested for assault have not been released.

In a response Tuesday to Ormsby's letter, Bailey did not directly address her allegations of racial bias but said she should stop making personal attacks. He acknowledged his previous error in stating the date of the fight was March 11, not March 8, and again directed the district to provide records for his investigation.

Associated Press calls and emails to the family attorney of the hospitalized girl were not immediately returned. The 15-year-old has not been named by police because she is a juvenile.

Issues with school resource officers in Hazelwood schools began in 2021, when the district tried to require police to attend 10 hours of diversity, equity and inclusion training to work at the schools.

Police chiefs from St. Louis County, Florissant and Hazelwood sent a letter to the school board in June of that year saying police “receive training that is more than adequate and addresses the critical matters of diversity, equity, and inclusion.”

No deal was reached between police and the schools, prompting the district to hire 60 private security guards to replace the school resource officers.

Hazelwood police later returned to some of the district's buildings as school resource officers. But Florissant and St. Louis County police never reached an agreement with the school district.

In a letter requesting documents from Hazelwood about the student fight, Bailey wrote that “the absence of SROs on the scene is directly attributable to Hazelwood's insistence on prioritizing race-based policies over basic student safety.”

Ormsby said school resource officers “would not have prevented a fight from occurring off school property and outside of the school day.”

Hazelwood spokeswoman Jordyn Elston said in a statement that the school district “does not prioritize DEI initiatives at the expense of student safety"" and believes the programs help student safety and learning.

“These values are not negotiable,"" Elston said, ""and we will continue to prioritize them in all aspects of our work as community leaders.”

(AP) — One of several Republican candidates jostling for North Dakota's only U.S. House seat has ended his campaign.

Former state Sen. Tom Campbell, a potato farmer from Grafton, announced on Tuesday he is withdrawing from the race.

“I feel it would be a better use of my time to avoid a negative campaign, ignoring any threats and focus on the positive, where I can contribute to the well-being of others,"" Campbell posted to Facebook. ""At a time where there seems to be too much division and anger, I believe I can make more of a difference taking a different path rather than as 1 in 435 in Congress.”

Several candidates are running to succeed Republican Rep. Kelly Armstrong, who first won the seat in 2018 and is now running for governor.

Campbell initially eyed the governor's race, then switched to the House race. In 2018, he initially ran for U.S. Senate, but later switched to the House race and ultimately withdrew.

Other Republican candidates for the House seat include former state Rep. Rick Becker, Public Service Commissioner Julie Fedorchak and Alex Balazs, a military veteran and former U.S. State Department employee.

Democrat and military veteran Trygve Hammer also is running. Republicans have held the seat since 2011.

Campbell's exit comes less than two weeks before the North Dakota Republican Party's state convention in Fargo, where delegates will endorse candidates for statewide and congressional races.

But some candidates in the open gubernatorial and congressional races have said they're taking their campaigns to the Republican primary election in June, when voters will decide the nominees for November.

(AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Thursday signed off on the repeal of police traffic stop reforms made in Memphis after the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols by officers in January 2023, despite pleas from Nichols’ parents to GOP lawmakers and the governor to give them a chance to find compromise.

The Republican governor’s signature means the law immediately renders some of Memphis’ ordinances null and void, including one that outlawed so-called pretextual traffic stops, such as for a broken taillight and other minor violations. Lee echoed arguments from Republican lawmakers who argued Nichols’ death needed to result in accountability for officers who abuse power, not new limits on how authorities conduct traffic stops.

“I think what’s most important for us to remember is that we can give law enforcement tools, but we’ve got to hold law enforcement to a standard of using those tools appropriately, where there’s an appropriate interaction with the public,” Lee told reporters Friday, earlier this month of his decision to sign the bill. “That’s not what we understand has happened all the time, and certainly their family would attest to that.”

To date, Lee has never vetoed a piece of legislation since taking office nearly seven years ago, only occasionally letting bills become law without signing them to send a message of his concern or disapproval. He rarely bucks his political party’s wishes, and he is notably attempting to push through a contentious universal school voucher bill where he needs Republican support in order for it to pass.

Nichols’ death last January sparked outrage and calls for reforms nationally and locally. Videos showed an almost 3-minute barrage of fists, feet and baton strikes to Nichols’ face, head, front and back, as the 29-year-old Black man yelled for his mother about a block from home.

Nichols’ parents, mother RowVaughn Wells and stepfather Rodney Wells, were among the advocates who drummed up support for the Memphis city council last year to pass ordinance changes.

Many Republican elected officials in Tennessee also joined in the public outcry over Nichols’ death at the time. The month afterward, Lee even mentioned the Nichols family in his annual State of the State speech, saying “their courage, along with the compassion shown by the people of Memphis, is a picture of hope.”

Yet the majority-white Legislature has repeatedly rebuffed many Black leaders' call for police reforms and oversight, and instead have sided with advocates who don’t want new limits on police authority.

In recent years, lawmakers have reacted similarly when they disagree with how Democrat-voting Memphis and Nashville run their cities. They have preempted local power to undo progressive policies, took more authority over local boards, and kept a hardline approach to crime in Memphis.

Nichols’ parents, in this case, said their attempts to get the bill sponsors to commit to finding some middle ground failed, leaving them and supporters in the Memphis community feeling marginalized and discouraged. Nichols’ parents said they felt misled by Rep. John Gillespie, leading them to skip one trip to Nashville when they thought he would delay the bill. Instead, House Republicans passed it without the Nichols’ parents there. Gillespie argued it was a miscommunication.

When they returned another day for the Senate vote, Sen. Brent Taylor denied their pleas to pause the bill and try to find middle ground. RowVaughn Wells was in tears after the exchange, and the couple left before the Senate passed the bill.

They also penned a letter to Lee before he ultimately signed the bill.

“After the death of our son, you generously offered your support in our pursuit of justice,” they wrote, imploring Lee to veto the bill. “This is that moment, Governor. We need your support now, more than ever.”

Five officers, who were also Black, were charged with federal civil rights violations in Nichols’ death, and second-degree murder and other criminal counts in state court. One has pleaded guilty in federal court. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating how Memphis Police Department officers use force and conduct arrests and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing.

Democratic lawmakers said the bill is a slap in the face to Nichols’ grieving parents and the government in majority-Black Memphis. Some also were flummoxed that state Republicans were trying to undo changes made in reaction to Nichols’ death even while federal authorities are still broadly investigating policing and race in Memphis.

(AP) — Mississippi lawmakers will try to negotiate on expanding Medicaid in one of the poorest states in the U.S. after the Senate voted Thursday for a vastly different plan than one proposed by the House.

The upper chamber's proposal would insure fewer people and bring less federal money to the state than the version approved by the House last month. But the Senate's approach includes a tougher work requirement and measures to prevent a wider expansion of Medicaid benefits in the future.

Senators debated the bill for nearly two hours before approving it in a 36-16 vote. The move to increase eligibility for the government-funded health insurance program that covers low-income people has set off a struggle between Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and members of his own party. In a social media post Wednesday, Reeves called the bill “Obamacare Medicaid” and said it would amount to “welfare expansion to those able-bodied adults that could work but choose not to.""

Republican Sen. Kevin Blackwell, who chairs the Senate Medicaid Committee, has dubbed the Senate proposal Medicaid expansion “lite,” and said it is much narrower that what is allowed under the Affordable Care Act, a 2010 federal health overhaul signed by then-President Barack Obama.

“Many of the comments I've seen recently on social media are misleading, inaccurate and designed to be inflammatory,"" Blackwell said. “This bill is not Obamacare expansion. This bill is a very responsible, conservative bill geared toward helping the working poor.”

The Senate's amended bill would extend eligibility only to those making up to 100% of the federal poverty level, just over $15,000 for one person. That is down from the 138% figure, just under $21,000 for one person, approved by the House.

House Medicaid Committee Chairwoman Missy McGee said her proposal could extend benefits to as many as 200,000 people. Blackwell said the new version of the bill approved by his committee could make 80,000 people eligible for expanded coverage, but he projects only about 40,000 would enroll.

Mississippi ranks at the bottom of virtually every health care indicator and at the top of every disparity. Hospitals are struggling to remain open. The state also has one of the nation’s lowest labor force participation rates. Expansion proponents have said the policy could help improve these conditions.

Senate Democrats introduced amendments that would have expanded Medicaid to more people, but Republicans voted them down on the floor. Even still, Senate Democrats all voted for the bill, with Minority Leader Derrick Simmons arguing that Mississippi is experiencing a “health care crisis” and that the bill is better than the status quo.

Opponents of Medicaid expansion say the program would foster government dependency, increase wait times for health services and push people off private insurance.

Republican lawmakers have said expansion without a work requirement is a nonstarter. The Senate version would require people to work at least 30 hours per week to become eligible for expanded benefits, up from the 20-hour work requirement approved by the House.

The Senate makes expansion depend on President Joe Biden’s administration approving its work requirement. But the administration has consistently revoked work requirement waivers, arguing people should not face roadblocks to getting health care.

Only Georgia has managed to tie a work requirement to a partial expansion of Medicaid benefits. But the state only requires people to document 80 monthly hours of work, 40 hours less than what Mississippi senators have proposed. Georgia’s program has seen abysmal enrollment.

The House proposal would have allowed expansion to continue without a work requirement, but the Senate version would disallow Medicaid expansion without one. Blackwell said he is counting on Biden losing in November to a Republican whose administration would welcome a work requirement.

Under the reduced eligibility level approved by the Senate, Mississippi would also lose an additional financial bonus for expanding Medicaid that would be available under the House’s version.

The bill now heads back the House, and Reeves is likely to veto the legislation if it reaches his desk. Lawmakers could override his veto with a two-thirds vote from the House and Senate.

FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced 25 Years

On Mar. 28, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison sentence for his involvement in a massive fraud and conspiracy that led to the downfall of his crypto exchange and affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research.

The verdict, delivered in Manhattan federal court, fell short of the 40 to 50 years sought by federal prosecutors but exceeded the five to six-and-a-half years proposed by Bankman-Fried’s defense team. Expressing concern about potential future wrongdoing, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced the 32-year-old and mandated an $11 billion forfeiture to the U.S. government.

Giga Energy Mines Bitcoin in Argentina

Brent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh, graduates of Texas A&M University, have been engaged in bitcoin mining in the oil fields of East Texas since 2019. Their company, Giga Energy, aims to utilize flared natural gas to generate electricity for bitcoin mining operations, known for their significant energy consumption.

Giga Energy recently announced its expansion into Argentina, marking its first venture outside the U.S. and Shanghai. Collaborating with Phoenix Global Resources, an oil and gas firm operating in Mendoza, and IT services provider Exa Tech, Giga plans to establish a two-megawatt bitcoin mining facility atop Vaca Muerta.

Bitcoin Spikes During Final Week of March

At the onset of the final week of March, Bitcoin surged, reclaiming the $70,000 threshold. According to Coin Metrics, the price of the leading crypto surged by 7.8% to reach $70,995.48, briefly touching $71,239.31 in late afternoon trading coinciding with the stock market closure. Ether also experienced a 7.4% increase, reaching $3,634.80, with most other cryptocurrencies following suit.

MicroStrategy, often regarded as a proxy for Bitcoin’s price, saw a notable 21% surge, while Coinbase recorded a 9% rise. The mining sector also benefited from Bitcoin’s rally, with Riot Platforms up by 9%, CleanSpark experiencing a 19% increase, and Cipher Mining gaining 13%.

KuCoin Charged With Violating Anti-Money Laundering Laws

On Mar. 26, U.S. federal prosecutors filed charges against crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders for allegedly violating anti-money laundering laws. The prosecutors claimed that the exchange operated within the U.S. misled at least one investor about its U.S. operations, and neglected to register with U.S. government authorities or establish an anti-money laundering program.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice indictment, KuCoin and its founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang ran the exchange as a money-transmitting business serving over 30 million customers. However, they allegedly did not implement a know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) program until 2023. Even after its implementation, the KYC program reportedly did not extend to existing customers. Neither Gan nor Tang were arrested, as stated in a DOJ press release.",Crypto NFT Today: March Week 4,"Welcome to another edition of Crypto NFT Today!

HAVANA TIMES – In Argentina, a court has convicted 11 former officials of crimes against humanity for committing atrocities against over 600 people during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. The victims included transgender women, high school students, and prisoners who gave birth in captivity and whose babies were taken from them. The court ruled the former military, police and government officials were involved in forced disappearances, torture, rape and murder at secret torture centers on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

On Sunday, thousands of Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires to remember the victims of the military dictatorship.

Rolando Gutierrez: “Today, some families here in Argentina are still searching for their children. The idea is that every March 24, we should remember that date so we don’t repeat those mistakes. A people that has a memory does not repeat those mistakes.”

This all comes as Argentina’s new far-right President Javier Milei faces renewed criticism for downplaying dictatorship-era atrocities.

(AP) — Trustees of Tennessee's only publicly funded historically Black university were removed Thursday under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Black lawmakers and community leaders said state leaders, a majority of whom are white, are unfairly targeting Tennessee State University.

The legislation cleared the state GOP-controlled House on Thursday in a 66-25 vote, and Lee signed off a few hours later without commenting on the controversial decision to vacate the board. He instead praised TSU as a “remarkable institution"" as he unveiled that he already had selected 10 new replacements.

“I’m pleased to appoint these highly qualified individuals who will work alongside administrators and students to further secure TSU’s place as a leading institution,” Lee said.

The new appointees, largely from the business community, are now subject to confirmation by the Legislature. Their selection will be critical as TSU is already seeking a new leader because President Glenda Glover plans to retire at the end of this school year.

“All we’re talking about is the board ... It’s vacating some personalities and bringing others in,” House Majority Leader William Lamberth told reporters. “The goal is to make TSU successful.”

Republican leaders have long grumbled about TSU's leadership as multiple state audits have found student housing shortages, unsustainable scholarship increases and lingering financial discrepancies. Audits released Thursday morning ahead of the House vote found 56 “significant procedural deficiencies” ranging from the school failing to follow its own procedures, to not properly documenting transactions or identifying improvements to its budgeting procedures.

However, one review stated that it “did not identify evidence indicative of fraud or malfeasance by executive leadership.”

Democrats and others say Republicans are focusing on the wrong issues, pointing out that TSU's problems are primarily due to its being underfunded by an estimated $2.1 billion over the last three decades. They also allege that the majority-white Legislature distrusts a Black-controlled university's ability to manage itself.

Rep. Bo Mitchell, a Democrat whose district includes TSU, also questioned removing the board of a historically Black college that the state has failed to adequately fund. “I’ve seen many audits of many universities that look horrendous,” Mitchell said. “Have we ever, ever vacated an entire board of a university before? Have we ever done that?""

Multiple Democrats filed last minute motions and amendments that would have delayed the vote or cut the number of board seats to be vacated to five rather than 10. Ultimately, the GOP supermajority voted down each of the proposals.

“Instead of us rectifying the problems that we created through racist policies by underfunding Tennessee State University, we’re now advocating to vacate their board,” said Rep. Justin Pearson, a Democrat from Memphis, raising his voice as he criticized his Republican colleagues.

Last year, the Tennessee Legislature provided TSU with a lump sum of $250 million for infrastructure projects to help fix a portion of the shortfall.

Republican Rep. Ryan Williams said that money was “completely blown through” after officials gave too many student scholarships, so many that students were placed in hotels because there wasn't enough housing. Other universities, including University of Tennessee in Knoxville, have also been required to house some students temporarily in hotels without the same criticism from state lawmakers.

“The challenges are dire,” Williams said. “But we have to have assurances that future investment, or that remedy to this problem, is going to be well taken care of.”

TSU supporters and students watched from the galleries Thursday and cheered at times when Democrats criticized the bill. Some booed Republicans once the legislation cleared, while others lamented at the Legislature's punishing response to the university's challenges.

“We have people who realize it takes a bridge sometimes to get where you’re trying to go,” Barry Barlow, a pastor and TSU grad said during a news conference after the vote. “But we have people in the Tennessee General Assembly who will take your bridge of promise and stick dynamite to it.”

(AP) — Kentucky's legislature delivered on a new two-year state budget Thursday that would increase funding for K-12 schools as lawmakers accomplished their biggest responsibility of this year's legislative session.

The spending plan won final passage in the House and now heads to Gov. Andy Beshear, who has line-item veto authority over state budget bills. The Senate gave its approval late Wednesday as lawmakers hurried to finish work on the budget and many other issues before starting a two-week break.

The main budget measure represents the state’s signature policy document and completing the two-year budget was the biggest task for the GOP supermajority legislature when this year's session started in early January. The final version was the product of negotiating sessions by legislative leaders.

Later Thursday, lawmakers gave final passage to a separate spending bill tapping into the state’s massive budget reserves to make one-time investments, including in infrastructure and economic development.

During the debate on the state's main budget bill, much of the focus, as usual, was on education funding.

Per-pupil funding under SEEK — the state's main funding formula for public K-12 schools — would increase by more than 9% during the next two-year budget cycle.

“This is a solid budget,” Republican Senate President Robert Stivers said Wednesday night. ""It is the best budget that has been proposed or passed by the General Assembly.”

Decisions on teacher pay raises would be left up to local school boards. Republican leaders said they hoped the influx of additional state funding would enable districts to award raises to teachers.

Republican Rep. Timmy Truett, a school principal, said Thursday that he had received upbeat assessments of the spending plan from a number of school superintendents

“They’re excited that with these significant increases, that they’re going to be able to maintain their staff and also give some sort of a raise,” he said during the House debate.

Critics of the spending plan said the legislature missed a prime opportunity — during a time of massive budget reserves — to award even more generous funding to K-12 schools. Democratic Rep. Adrielle Camuel said the funding levels in the bill would not tackle the shortage of classroom teachers.

“Without a dedicated raise for teachers and school employees, Kentucky school districts will still struggle to fill these vacancies,” she said.

The decision to leave those salary decisions up to local schools boards reflected an ongoing philosophical difference between Republican lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. The governor, who won reelection last year, proposed an 11% pay raise for teachers and all other public school employees.

Beshear has said an 11% raise would lift Kentucky to the middle of the pack nationally in average teacher starting pay and average teacher pay. The state now ranks near the bottom in both categories.

The spending plan approved by lawmakers also would boost state funding for school districts' transportation costs. The state would fund 90% of those costs in the first year of the next budget cycle and would fully funds those expenses in the second year, legislative leaders said.

The budget bill also would steer more state funding to less-wealthy school districts to balance out funding disparities with wealthier districts.

Republican Senate President Pro Tem David Givens said Wednesday that the emphasis on education funding signals that teachers are appreciated and that Kentucky is a good place to work as an educator.

“Any rhetoric that makes you feel like you’re not appreciated, please disregard that,"" Givens said. ""We value what you do, day in and day out, and this budget reflects that.”

Another Beshear priority that made no headway was his proposal to provide preschool for every 4-year-old in Kentucky. Republican lawmakers included no money in the budget for his proposal. The governor’s budget plan included $172 million each year of the two-year budget for his universal pre-K plan. The program would extend preschool education to an estimated 34,000 additional 4-year-olds, he said.

The Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence praised the funding for full-day kindergarten and public universities but said the budget bill fell short of needed investments in early childhood education. The Prichard Committee is a statewide citizens’ group that advocates for improved Kentucky schools.

“Significantly more funding and policy innovation is needed to expand access to quality, affordable early childhood education, which is a critical missing piece to growing Kentucky’s economy both today and in the future,” Prichard Committee President/CEO Brigitte Blom said in a statement Thursday.

The other appropriations measure that won final passage would make a number of one-time investments, financed by a portion of the state's budget reserves. It would allocate $450 million over two years to the road fund to support projects to help spur economic development and improve quality of life, a Senate GOP news release said. Other funding would help pay down state pension liabilities and finance school improvements, community development, water projects and substance abuse treatment programs.

After Thursday, lawmakers will return to the Capitol for a two-day wrap-up session in mid-April, when they will take up any gubernatorial vetoes as well as remaining bills.

Jackley said he intends ""to prosecute those responsible for any harm done to correctional officers, other inmates, and state property to the fullest extent of the law.”

South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem said a correctional officer was assaulted Wednesday and taken to a hospital “because of some tablets that were removed from prisoners,” KELO-TV reported.

According to KELO-TV, Noem said she was “extremely proud” of the corrections officers for getting the situation back under control. She added that inmates were using the electronic tablets for “nefarious reasons.""

“They were not being used, in all situations, to just contact home,"" Noem said. “They were being used for other purposes that were not good and not legal.”

A memo from March 20 on the Department of Corrections website said tablet communication features — including phone calls, messages and pictures — have been suspended since March 8 on all department tablets statewide due to an “investigation pending resolution.""

Inmates “still have access to wall phones to contact their attorneys and families,” according to the memo.

The only survivor was an 8-year-old child who was receiving medical attention for serious injuries.

The Limpopo provincial government said the bus veered off the Mmamatlakala bridge in northern South Africa and plunged 50 meters (164 feet) into a ravine before busting into flames.

Search operations were ongoing, the provincial government said, but many bodies were burned beyond recognition and trapped inside the vehicle, while others had been thrown from the bus.

The crash happened near the town of Mokopane, which is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the South African capital, Pretoria.

Hours after the crash, smoke seeped from the mangled, burned wreck underneath the concrete bridge. Authorities said it appeared that the driver lost control and the bus ploughed into the barriers along the side of the bridge and then over the edge. The driver was one of the dead.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the victims appeared to be all from Botswana and had been on their way to the town of Moria in Limpopo for a popular Easter weekend pilgrimage that attracts hundreds of thousands of worshippers from South Africa and neighboring countries who follow the Zion Christian Church.

Ramaphosa had phoned Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi to offer his condolences and said the South African government would do all it can to help, according to a statement from Ramaphosa's office.

Provincial authorities said the bus had a Botswana license plate.

South African Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga was in Limpopo province for a road safety campaign and changed plans to visit the crash scene after hearing the ""devastating news,"" the national Department of Transport said. She said there was an investigation underway into the cause of the crash and offered her condolences to the families of the victims.

The South African government often warns motorists to be cautious during the Easter holidays, which is a particularly busy and dangerous time for road travel. More than 200 people died in road crashes during the Easter weekend last year.

Just a day before the bus crash, the South African government called on people to be extra careful on Thursday and Friday because of the expected high volumes traveling by road to Moria.

The Zion Christian Church has its headquarters in Moria and this year is the first time its Easter pilgrimage is set to go ahead since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zelenskiy has called for public officials to disclose their incomes as part of efforts to increase transparency and eliminate corruption as Ukraine tries to meet the stringent requirements for its bid to join the European Union.

Western allies providing weaponry and financial assistance as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund have also sought assurances on efforts to eliminate corruption.

Medellín's Mayor Federico Gutiérrez said the ban will be enforced in Provenza and El Poblado, two neighborhoods teeming with trendy bars and clubs and frequented by thousands of tourists.

The neighborhoods have also become popular with sex workers who walk the streets in search of international clients. Gutiérrez said criminal networks are taking minors to these districts and forcing them into sex work.

“We have to recover the control of this area,” Gutiérrez said at a news conference. “It is also very important for us to protect the community.”

Sex work is legal in Colombia if it involves consenting adults. But local governments can ban this activity temporarily from parts of cities, if it is deemed a threat to public order.

The Medellín prostitution ban comes just days after an American man was found in a hotel room with two local girls aged 12 and 13, in a case widely covered by local media.

The 36-year-old was held in police custody for 12 hours, then released while officials investigated the case. Local media reported that he left Colombia and went to Florida.

During Monday's news conference, Gutiérrez urged Colombian authorities to speed up the investigation.

“It is sad to see how many people believe they can come to Medellín and do whatever they want,"" he said.

Sex work has grown in Medellín as the city of 3 million people becomes increasingly popular with tourists, who head to Medellín for its balmy weather, affordable prices and festive atmosphere.

While some tourists meet sex workers directly in the city’s streets, others are meeting them through dating apps and some of these encounters have turned violent.

In January, the State Department issued a security alert on the risks of using dating apps in Medellín, after eight Americans were killed there in the prior two months.

The alert said criminals were using dating apps to lure visitors to hotels, restaurants and bars where they were drugged, kidnapped or robbed.

Other Latin American countries — including Brazil and Colombia on the left and Uruguay on the right — also rallied around Mexico.

Mexican authorities had granted Glas asylum, but the government of Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa had argued the protection was illegal because of the corruption charges the left-wing politician was facing. Still, under international law, embassies are considered the sovereign territory of the country they represent.

In a brief communiqué, the Argentine foreign ministry joined the countries of the region in condemning “what happened last night at the Mexican Embassy in Ecuador.” The press release also mentioned that Argentina is part of the 1954 Convention on Diplomatic Asylum, which has recently granted this status to Venezuelan political leaders and is awaiting the issuance of the corresponding safe-conducts.

The Argentine government called for “full compliance with the provisions of [the convention], and with the obligations arising from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.”

Broad condemnation

Friday’s raid triggered a suspension of relations with Quito by Mexico City, with the government of Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador blasting the unusual diplomatic incursion and arrest as an “authoritarian” act as well as a breach of international law and Mexico’s sovereignty.

Glas could be seen on video circulating on social media being taken by police convoy to the airport in the capital, Quito, flanked by heavily armed soldiers. He then boarded a plane en route to a jail in Guayaquil, the Andean nation’s largest city.

Brazil’s government condemned Ecuador’s move as a “clear violation” of international norms prohibiting such a raid on a foreign embassy. Ecuador’s move against the embassy “must be subject to strong repudiation, whatever the justification for its implementation,” according to a statement from Brazil’s foreign ministry, which stressed Brasilia’s solidarity with Mexico.

In an interview with local broadcaster Milenio on Saturday morning, Mexico’s top diplomat Alicia Barcena, expressed shock at Ecuador’s incursion into the country’s embassy, located in Quito’s financial district, adding that some embassy personnel were injured in the raid. She added that Glas was granted asylum after an exhaustive analysis of the circumstances surrounding the accusations he faces.

The Mexican foreign ministry has announced it will file a complaint with the United Nation’s International Court of Justice for “grave violations of international law.”

Also on Saturday, the Washington-based Organization of American States issued a call for dialogue to resolve the escalating dispute between Ecuador and Mexico, adding in a statement that a session of the body’s permanent council will be convened to discuss the need for “strict compliance with international treaties, including those that guarantee the right to asylum.”

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, meanwhile, argued in a post on X that Latin America “must keep alive the precepts of international law in the midst of the barbarism that is advancing in the world.” Petro’s government noted it will seek human rights legal protections for the now-detained Glas, according to a separate statement.

Glas, convicted twice for corruption, had been holed up in the embassy in Quito since seeking political asylum in December, a request Mexico granted on Friday.

Ecuadorean authorities had unsuccessfully sought permission from Mexico to enter the embassy and arrest Glas.

In 2017, Glas, the former second-in-command to ex-President Rafael Correa, also a leftist, was sentenced to six years in prison after he was found guilty of taking bribes from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht in exchange for awarding it government contracts.

As he faced a fresh arrest warrant on separate graft charges, Glas has claimed he is the victim of political persecution, a charge Ecuador’s government has denied.

(AP) — Mississippi's capital city, which has nation-leading rates of gun violence, will receive additional federal resources to investigate crimes committed with firearms, federal officials announced Wednesday.

The Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has deployed a mobile unit to Jackson that will assist law enforcement agencies in the region with investigating gun-related crimes, Sheila Wilbanks, a spokesperson for the U.S. Southern District of Mississippi, said in a news release.

It is the latest move in a coordinated effort among local, state and federal, law enforcement officials to surge resources for operations aimed at curbing violent crime in the city. Even though Jackson’s homicide rate had dropped for two consecutive years, it still led the nation in killings per capita in 2023, according to an analysis conducted by WLBT-TV. The city of almost 150,000 recorded 118 killings last year.

In February, officials announced Operation Unified, an initiative targeting drug traffickers and violent criminals.

The mobile unit, a National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, is a database of bullet casings recovered from crime scenes across the country. Investigators can use the database to check if the casings recovered from a crime scene were fired from a gun that may have been used in other crimes, allowing them to disrupt “shooting cycles,” Wilbanks said.

In 2022, the Justice Department awarded Jackson a $675,000 grant for investigations of crimes. committed with firearms.

Nexus Services must pay roughly $231 million in restitution as well as penalties of $13.8 million to New York, $7.1 million to Virginia and $3.4 million to Massachusetts, according to a judgement filed in federal court for the Western District of Virginia in Harrisonburg. The Virginia-based company, its subsidiary Libre by Nexus and its three executives must also each pay more than $111 million in civil penalties.

“This judgment is a victory for thousands of immigrant families who lost their life savings and were targeted and preyed on by Libre,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “Libre exploited vulnerable immigrants and their families to pad its pockets, and that is illegal and unconscionable.”

James joined state attorneys general in Virginia and Massachusetts and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2021 lawsuit that accused the company of violating state and federal consumer protection laws.

The officials said the company promised to secure immigrants’ release on bond while their immigration claims were being processed but concealed and misrepresented the true nature and costs of its services. They said the company collected thousands of dollars in fees above the face value of the bonds and forced immigrants to wear painful ankle monitors.

U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon noted in her decision that the company isn't a licensed bail bond agent or a surety company certified by the U.S. Treasury but a ""service provider that acts as an intermediary between immigration detainees and sureties and their bond agents.”

The company said in a statement that it intends to appeal the judgement, calling it a “shocking departure from normal American jurisprudence"" as it was decided “without evidence, without a trial and without a damages hearing.”

“We continue to remain committed to serving our clients - people who suffer and sacrifice for a better life, and who do not deserve to be political pawns in an American legislature or an American courtroom,"" the company added.

Lopez said that there isn’t major unrest in the country and claims about problems in Venezuela are untrue and come from right wing anti-government forces inside Venezuela and expatriates living in the US and Colombia .

Lopez warned: ‘As we approach 28th July, violent attempts to destroy the government of Venezuela will increase.

‘This is because those doing so represent the imperialist interests of the United States who oppose the Bolivarian revolution which took place in Venezuela.

‘Thanks to President Nicolás Maduro, and the maturity of the Venezuelan people, as well as the commitment of the Bolivarian National Armed Force (FANB), we have been able to keep the country calm.’

On Saturday, 30th March, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil warned the population about an alleged armed offensive, devised by right wing forces in Venezuela to attack and violate national sovereignty, through a ‘libertarian movement’ formed by mercenaries linked to Operation Gideon and led from the United States.

Gil said: ‘The attempt by the pro-US forces in Venezuela cause divisions and are an attempt to get hold of the oil and other raw materials in the country, and will not help the Venezuelan people in any way.

‘No further explanation is needed: Venezuela’s far-right believes in neither democracy nor elections.’

Right wing politician Mario Iván Carratú Molina, who is currently in the United States, is trying to organise a ‘libertarian movement’ in Venezuela.

The secretary general of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Peoples Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP), Jorge Arreaza, also said that anti-government protests in Venezuela are being organised from the US and Colombia.

Last Thursday, Communication Minister Freddy Ñañez said that there is a concerted media campaign to trivialise the most recent assassination attempt on Maduro which occurred in Venezuela last month.

On 25th March, the authorities apprehended two men in Caracas, where Maduro was registering his candidacy for the July presidential elections.

The men were found with guns on them which they would have used to shoot Maduro.

In the investigations following last Monday’s events, Attorney General Tarek William Saab determined that the detainees were linked to ‘Vente Venezuela’, a far-right organisation that has been associated with previous coup attempts .

Through a message on social media, the Communication Minister also responded to statements from right wing journalist Sebastiana Barraez which he said were an attempt to create unrest and over throw the government.

Barraez was involved in a previous coup attempt operation called ‘White Bracelet’.

Saab added: ‘It is a desperate manoeuvre in the foreign media to try to both stir unrest and make it look like the government are unpopular when they are backed by the majority of the population.

‘This clearly demonstrates that both conspiracies are linked and are part of a multi-faceted plan.

‘People spreading absurd narratives about the detainees do not act innocently.

‘They are playing a role in covering up a serious crime against the constitutional order.

‘Barraez is attempting to promote a narrative based on lies aimed at manipulating public opinion, and obstructing investigations into movements against the government.’

The Communications Ministry said in a statement that the evidence presented by Attorney General Saab clearly demonstrates Barraez’s criminal attitude.

The statement said: ‘If we review the irrefutable evidence presented by Saab, we will understand why it took two days to construct a laughable yet dangerous fake news story about protests in Caracas which did not happen.

‘What is striking is her fervent and crude campaign to whitewash Vente Venezuela in a proven assassination operation in which the hitmen have been convicted and have confessed.’

The Venezuelan ministry also explained that terrorist actions operate not only in the physical realm but also in the virtual sphere, as far-right media ‘distract, distort, and lie in favour of the operation.’

Last Saturday in Paraguay, relatives and friends mourned the death of Martín Almada, the Human Rights advocate.

Almada, a lawyer, activist and author who wrote the book ‘Archives of Terror’ about the dictatorship in Paraguay which was in power from 1954 until 1989, had been arrested and tortured on 26 November 1974 by the military regime of General Alfredo Stroessner.

Almada died at the age of 87, after a long battle with a disease that kept him in hospital.

Paraguay president Santiago Peña said: ‘I would like to express my eternal gratitude for Martín Almada, teacher and freedom fighter’.

Almada was arrested in 1954 and served time in prison until he was released in 1977, when he went into exile in Panama and later to Paris, where he worked for Unesco.

He returned to his country in 1989, after the fall of the Stroessner dictatorship.

Almada wrote about police repression in the country and exposed the ‘Condor Plan’, which involved several South American dictatorships between 1970 and 1980.

He documented the crimes of right-wing military governments, many of whom were formed with the help of the United States’ CIA.

His biographer and writer, Pablo Daniel Magee, said that Almada’s work is studied in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Colombia, Portugal, Argentina and Chile, among other countries.

Magee said: ‘Martín Almada died but his struggle remains intact and the resolution with which we will carry forward the cause of human rights is stronger than ever.

‘It is the proof that there is no obstacle that can stop the human being when he has a conviction.

‘Almada’s greatest legacy was his book the ‘Archives of Terror’.

Former president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, has condemned ex-President Jair Bolsonaro, who last year eliminated the Commission of Dead and Disappeared, an institution that had been investigating the crimes of the 1964-1985 military dictatorships since 1995.

Rouseff drew parallels to a coup attempt that Bolsanoro organised in January of last year after he lost the Presidential elections to current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022.

Rousseff, who was herself a victim of torture during the military dictatorship (1964-1985), defended the importance of remembering the coup d’état of 1964, of which happened 60 years ago on Monday.

She said: ‘Maintaining the memory and the historical truth about the military coup that occurred in Brazil 60 years ago is crucial to ensure that the tragedy does not recur, as almost happened recently on 8th January, 2023.

‘History does not erase the signs of betrayal of democracy or clean from the national conscience the acts of perversity of those who exiled and stained the Brazilian life with blood, torture and death for 21 years.

‘Nor does it rescue those who supported the attack on institutions, democracy and the ideals of a more just and less unequal society.

‘Dictatorship never again!’

Relatives of victims of the dictatorship and human rights associations are planning to march in the city of São Paulo this Sunday from a former torture centre to the Ibirapuera Park, to ‘not forget’ the pain caused by the dictatorship.

Victims of the 1964 coup are demanding the ‘demilitarisation of the police’ and the creation of mechanisms against torture, and the reissue and publication of history textbooks from the victims’ perspective.

Meanwhile in Peru, police have raided President Dina Boluarte’s home as part of a corruption inquiry dubbed ‘Rolexgate’.

Authorities were searching for more than a dozen Rolex watches President Boluarte had allegedly not declared.

The investigation began after a news report drew attention to luxury watches she wore at public events, dating from when she took office in December 2022.

Peru’s government described the raid on Saturday as ‘disproportionate and unconstitutional’.

Peruvian Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen said: ‘The political noise that is being made is serious, affecting investments and the entire country.’

The government comptroller announced earlier this month it would review Boluarte’s asset declarations from the past two years.

Speaking last week, Boluarte insisted she entered government ‘with clean hands’ and that she would ‘leave it with clean hands’.",US trying to destabilise Venezuela before July election!,"VLADIMIR Padrino López, the Venezuelan Defence Minister, has denounced what he has called a new US-backed attempt to destabilise the country before the Presidential election at the end of July.

A police statement said the fragments were found near the villages of Etulia and Vladiceni and bore the inscription Heran-2, another name for Iranian-made Shahed drones used by Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.

The fragments were found in an area about 500 metres (1,600 feet) from the border with Ukraine, with access to the area restricted, the police said. There were no dangerous elements in the fragments and no danger to the area's residents.

There have been several instances of fragments of Russian drones and missiles found on the territory of Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania. Drone fragments were found near the same villages in February.

Pro-European President Maia Sandu has denounced Russia's invasion of its neighbour and singles out Moscow and corruption as the two biggest threats to her country's sovereignty.

Sandu has set a drive to join the European Union as her main policy goal.

(AP) — A U.S. House race in California appears headed for a mathematically improbable result – after more than 180,000 votes were cast, a tie for second place.

If the numbers hold, that means that the state’s “top two” election system would have to make room for a third candidate on the November ballot, an apparent first for a House race in the state.

“This is a fantastically unlikely outcome,” said Paul Mitchell of Political Data Inc., a research firm that closely tracks voting trends.

Eleven candidates were on the ballot in the heavily Democratic 16th District in the March 5 primary, south of San Francisco, a seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo. Under California rules, all candidates appear on the same primary ballot, but only the two with the most votes advance to the general election, regardless of political party.

The top spot was claimed by former San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, according to unofficial results that indicated all votes had been tallied. Two other Democrats were deadlocked for the second spot, with 30,249 votes each — state Assembly member Evan Low and Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian.

Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who oversees elections, has until April 12 to certify the results.

With three Democrats potentially headed for November, the contest will not play into control of the narrowly divided House, which will be decided in swing districts being contested by Democrats and Republicans around the country.

The tallies for Low and Simitian seesawed in recent days before settling into a tie on Wednesday — “It’s a special ‘Tie’ day!” Low tweeted at the time, sporting a brightly colored necktie in a photo.

The race also is a reminder of the state's agonizingly slow vote counting — in this case, the outcome remains in doubt weeks after election day. The cost of a recount must be paid by whoever requests it, and with a cost likely to rise over $300,000 for a second count, it seems unlikely from any of the campaigns.

A three-way contest in November, with a different electorate coming to the polls, would reshuffle the dynamics of the race — “a total reset,” Mitchell noted.

“It's really, really, really unlikely this would happen,” he said.

Police officials have been slow to release disciplinary reports resulting from the department's response to the sometimes violent protests that erupted after Floyd was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a white former officer who knelt on the Black man's neck for nearly 9 1/2 minutes, on May 25, 2020. A bystander video captured Floyd’s fading cries of “I can’t breathe.” His death forced a reckoning with police brutality and racism.

The recent releases were first reported Friday by the Star Tribune. The department doesn’t generally disclose the outcome of disciplinary cases until they’ve gone through the entire review and appeal process. It went more than a year before acknowledging even a written reprimand to one officer for talking to a reporter for GQ magazine without authorization about the “toxic culture” in the department after Floyd’s death.

The unsealed, sometimes heavily redacted reports are posted on a department dashboard on disciplinary decisions from a range of incidents. Some of the most serious sanctions handed down in cases related to the unrest came from an assault by police May 30, 2020, on Jaleel Stallings.

Officials with the officers' union, the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday.

Many details in the Stallings case came to light in earlier court cases, but the reports detail some of the reasons former Interim Police Chief Amelia Huffman gave for firing Officer Justin Stetson and suspending others. In the redacted report on Stetson, Huffman wrote that he used ""unreasonable force"" that could have resulted in “even more grave” injuries.

Stallings, an Army veteran with a permit to carry a gun, had fired three shots at an unmarked police van after Stetson shot him with a 40 mm “less lethal” round, the report noted. The officers were enforcing a curfew that night. When Stallings realized they were police, he dropped his gun, lay on the ground and did not resist. But Stetson kicked him in the face and in the head, punched him multiple times and slammed his head into the pavement, Huffman noted.

Stallings — who suffered a fracture of his eye socket, plus cuts and bruises — argued in resulting court cases that he thought civilians had attacked him, and that he fired in self-defense. Stetson last year pleaded guilty to assault and was given probation. The city agreed in 2022 to pay Stallings a $1.5 million settlement, after Stallings was acquitted of an attempted murder charge.

Other discipline arising from that incident included a 120-hour suspension for Officer Tyler Klund for kicking Stallings and for punching a man who was with Stallings that night in the head, and failure to activate his body camera. Huffman also handed down 80-hour suspensions for Officers Michael Pfaff and Michael Osbeck for their actions against the other man. Pfaff used his Taser on him nine times in less than a minute, she said.

Officer Kristopher Dauble got a 40-hour suspension for firing 40 mm rounds at pedestrians about a block away from where police confronted Stallings. Huffman said it was fortunate that nobody was injured as a result.

Sgt. Kevin Angerhofer, who oversaw SWAT teams in the area that night, got a 60-hour suspension for failing to conduct a proper force review.

An earlier report, signed by Medaria Arradondo, who was police chief when Floyd was killed, gave details on the attempted firing of Sgt. Ronald Stenerson, who sprayed a chemical agent into the face of Vice News journalist Michael Anthony Adams when he was already lying on his stomach, holding his press credentials for officers to see. Stenerson did not document his actions and did not activate his body camera, the report said. The Star Tribune reported previously that Stenerson contested his firing and stayed on the job before later resigning.

Arradondo said Stenerson's actions were all the more egregious because he was a supervisor, so his conduct “cannot be tolerated or accepted.”

The reports also show that current Police Chief Brian O’Hara handed down suspensions last May of 10 to 40 hours against three officers who confronted protesters who blocked the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis on May 31, 2020.

Next month, Sotheby’s New York will be hosting its annual Contemporary Evening Auction, and headlining the event will be a canvas from Fontana’s Concetto Spaziale, La fine di Dio (translating to Spatial Concept, The End of God) series gathered by Texas-based collectors Cindy and Howard Rachofsky. The punctured, cadmium-yellow piece is slated to hit the auction block with an estimate between $20 million to $30 million, making it one of the most valuable works by Fontana ever offered. The Rachofskys originally acquired the egg-shaped painting for a record-setting $2.3 million in 2003.

A yellow Lucio Fontana canvas could sell for $20 million to $30 million at auction.

“This is Lucio Fontana at his finest,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art in a press statement. “Dazzling like the sun itself, the painting is the ultimate testament to the artist’s decades-long fascination with depth, light, and space. Just as the impact of the Second World War and the atomic bomb broke open a new language for Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, the advent of space exploration, ushered in by Yuri Gagarin’s flight in 1961, became the catalyst for opening a new dimension of painting with Fontana’s La fine di Dio series.”

According to the auction house, this is the first time that a yellow Concetto spaziale, La fine di Dio will be offered at auction since 2015. That year, a canvas in the same vibrant hue set the artist’s auction record when it sold for an eye-watering $29.2 million. Of the 38 post-war Italian paintings in the series, there were only four that were created in monochrome yellow. This specific work, however, was part of Fontana’s retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2019.

The punctured artwork comes from the collection of Cindy and Howard Rachofsky.

“Collecting art has given us a new perspective on the world—one that is informed by looking beyond the established American canon and toward the greatest achievements in art making around the globe,” the Rachofskys said in a press statement. “Lucio Fontana is an artist who has always fascinated us. His groundbreaking approach to abstraction and the philosophical themes in his work have been foundational in evolving our thinking about the collection. The pursuit to find the perfect Fine di Dio painting took many years, and when we finally found it, it raised the bar for our collection to another level—an approach which has guided us in making further acquisitions over the course of our collecting journey.”

Sotheby’s Contemporary Evening Auction will take place on May 13. If you want to scope out Fontana’s Concetto spaziale, La fine di Dio ahead of time, the series will be on display in Sotheby’s galleries in Milan from April 5-11 and then in New York from May 3-13.

The United Kingdom (UK) Antarctic Heritage Trust is looking to hire five people — a base leader, a shop manager, and three general assistants — to work at the ""Penguin Post Office"" in Port Lockroy, Antarctica. The five-month stint is open to UK residents over the age of 18. It will begin in early November 2024 and last until March 2025.

Responsibilities will include sorting the over 80,000 letters and postcards sent by the 18,000 tourists who visit the world's southernmost post office each summer. Employees will also help sell postage stamps, run the small onsite gift shop, and look after the aging building. But their most important duty will be to keep track of Port Lockroy's colony of about 1,500 gentoo penguins.

Exciting as it may sound, the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust warns applicants that the jobs are not for the faint of heart. Even during summer, temperatures on the icy continent can dip as low as 23 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 5 degrees Celsius). Additionally, the five people will live in a single bedroom with a tiny gas-powered kitchen. There is no flushing toilet either. Instead, staffers will use a camping toilet, which must be emptied daily.

There is limited phone and Internet access and no running water. Visiting ships provide water in jerry cans and also offer staffers showers every few days. But in poor weather conditions, they may have to do without a shower for extended periods. With the closest hospital in Argentina, medical evacuations could take up to a week! However, the biggest challenge will be the smell of penguin poop that will engulf them for five months!

The employees will all live together in one bedroom (Credit: UK Antarctic Heritage Trust/ CC-BY-SA-4.0)

Despite these drawbacks, the positions, which open up every summer, receive thousands of applications each year. Camilla Nichol, the Trust's CEO, is not surprised. She believes that for the right individuals, the jobs provide ""[a] unique opportunity to live in a landscape that makes you feel pure awe and wonder, where pioneering generations have gone before us, making groundbreaking discoveries about our planet.""

Officials at the 52,000-student university, one of the largest college campuses in the U.S., have not said how many jobs were eliminated. University President Jay Hartzell told the campus in a letter this week that additional measures will be taken to comply with the state’s new law. He said the university plans to shut down its Division of Campus and Community Engagement, which houses programs that support student learning and community building.

Hartzell's announcement also said associate and assistant deans who focused on DEI initiatives would return to their full-time faculty jobs and positions for staff who supported them would no longer be funded.

The school's chapter of the American Association of University Professors has estimated that 60 people in DEI roles at the campus were let go but have not said how it arrived at that number. In a letter sent Thursday, the group argued that the cuts violated employees' rights to academic freedom, due process and freedom of expression. It also criticized what it called a lack of transparency about how decisions were made and why input from faculty council was not taken into account.

“Although clearly not the intention, such actions can lead to a loss of trust and a perception of dishonesty,” the letter said.

The changes come as public universities in Texas were forced to make swift changes to comply with a new law passed last year by the state's Republican-controlled statehouse. Known as Senate Bill 17, it is one of the strictest bans passed on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and took effect on January 1.

School officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. The university this week declined to answer questions about how many faculty or staff members were impacted by the cuts.

The new Texas laws applies to the state's more than 30 public institutions — which serve over 600,000 students in higher education. It bans the universities from influencing hiring practices with affirmative action and other approaches that take into account applicants' race, sex or ethnicity. It also prohibits promoting “differential” or “preferential” treatment or what it called “special” benefits for people based on these categories and forbids training and activities conducted “in reference to race, color, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation.”

At least five other states have already passed their own bans. This year, Republican lawmakers in over a dozen other states are pursuing various restrictions on diversity initiatives, an issue that some hope will mobilize their voters this election year. The legislation mostly focuses on higher education, though some also restrict DEI efforts in K-12 schools, state government, contracting and pension investments.

The move by University of Texas leaders to shut down the campus' community engagement division came days after Republican state Sen. Brandon Creighton, who authored the bill, sent letters to regents of multiple public university systems inviting them to testify before state lawmakers about the changes made to comply with the new law.

Creighton also warned that simply renaming programs would not be considered compliance and reiterated that non-compliance could lead schools to lose funding.

LOUIS (AP) — The Association of Black Students at St. Louis' Washington University on Friday held a sit-in at a dining hall where a group of students last month allegedly threw eggs, stood on tables and used racial slurs in front of primarily racial minority workers.

University spokesperson Julie Flory in a statement said the private college does not “share information about any specific incident or investigation involving our students or other members of our community.”

“We are working directly with our students and other members of our community to address their concerns,” Flory said.

Dining hall workers felt intimidated and uncomfortable when students on March 21 jumped on tables, spit at each other and used racial slurs, the president of a local food workers union, David Cook, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The Association of Black Students told the newspaper that most of the workers that night were racial minorities.

St. Louis Democratic state Sen. Karla May in a Friday statement said she reached out to student advocates and campus leaders “to ensure steps are being taken to address these overt acts of racism.”

The Association of Black Students met at the cafeteria Friday to write thank-you notes and show support for workers who were present during the alleged incident, which the group said was “not an isolated instance of violence.”

“It shows how racism is still a part of the culture and has been fostered at Washington University, elite institutions, and historically white organizations for far too long,” the group said in a statement posted on the social media platform Instagram.

(AP) — The owner of a towboat that sank and spilled oil into a river along the West Virginia-Kentucky border was sentenced Monday to 18 months probation on a federal pollution charge, and he and his two companies were ordered to pay nearly $1.9 million in restitution.

David K. Smith of Paducah, Kentucky, owned River Marine Enterprises LLC and Western River Assets LLC. His towboat, the Gate City, sank while docked in the Big Sandy River in January 2018, discharging oil and other substances. The city of Kenova, West Virginia, closed its municipal drinking water intake for three days while regulatory agencies responded to the spill, according to court records.

Smith's companies were fined $100,000 each and a federal judge Monday ordered the defendants to pay the restitution amount that prosecutors said was the cost to the Coast Guard to remediate the damage.

A November 2017 Coast Guard inspection of the vessel had determined it could harm public health and the environment due to the threat of an oil discharge. Officials said at the time the vessel had the potential to spill 5,000 gallons (18,927 litres).

An administrative order required Smith to remove all oil and hazardous materials from the Gate City before Jan. 31, 2018, but Smith admitted he had not complied at the time of the spill, prosecutors said. Smith also said a contractor that was supposed to remove oil from the vessel before it sank could not access it safely due to site conditions.

In fact, it’s exactly the sort of no-holds-barred crimefighting they expect and voted for.

Ecuadorians were looking for their action man last election, fed up with widespread corruption and the robberies, kidnappings, extortions and murders fueled by the growing presence of international drug cartels. Noboa, often sporting bulletproof vests, sunglasses and leather jackets as well as the occasional smart-casual white T-shirt, so far seems to be fulfilling that role. If stopping lawbreakers in their tracks means breaching an embassy, then so be it, Ecuadorians interviewed over the weekend told The Associated Press.

“President Noboa has given a strong message to the nation,"" said Carlos Galecio, a political communications consultant and coordinator of the communications program at Ecuador's Casa Grande University. “(It's) a very powerful image boost.”

Noboa, the 36-year-old heir to one of Ecuador's largest fortunes, was sworn in as president in November after unexpectedly winning a special election in August. He defeated the protege of leftist ex-President Rafael Correa, who avoided serving a prison sentence related to a corruption conviction by moving to Belgium and securing asylum there.

Noboa inherited a country where people no longer leave home unless absolutely necessary, almost everyone knows a crime victim and many consider migrating. Statistics back those decisions and experiences: Last year was Ecuador’s bloodiest on record, with more than 7,600 homicides — up from 4,600 the prior year.

The causes for the spike are complex but largely revolve around cocaine. Cartel-aided gangs are battling for control of the streets, prisons and drug routes to the Pacific. Dwindling state coffers, soaring debts, political infighting and corruption created funding gaps in social and law-enforcement programs. And the COVID-19 pandemic turned hungry children and unemployed adults into easy recruits for criminal groups.

Noboa has responded by promising more equipment for police and the armed forces and the construction of prisons similar to those President Nayib Bukele built in El Salvador, with high-security, maximum-security and supermax units. He also issued a decree labeling more than 20 criminal groups as terrorist organizations and scheduled an April referendum to ask voters to extend the powers of the military to patrol the streets and control prisons.

Recent survey results from Ecuador-based public opinion firm Cedatos showed that more than two-thirds of respondents approve of Noboa's presidency and more than half support his decision to summon voters to the polls.

Police entered the Mexican embassy in Quito, the capital, to arrest former Vice President Jorge Glas, a convicted criminal and fugitive who had been living there since December. In his first comments on the operation, Noboa said Monday he has made “exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of impunity for criminals, corrupt people or narco-terrorists.”

“My obligation is to comply with the rulings of the justice system, and we could not allow sentenced criminals involved in very serious crimes to be given asylum,” which, Noboa argued, would violate the Vienna Convention and other international accords. In a statement posted on the social platform X, Noboa did not mention Glas by name but suggested he was in “imminent flight risk.”

Diplomatic premises are considered foreign soil and “inviolable” under the Vienna treaties and host country law enforcement agencies are not allowed to enter without permission from the ambassador. Mexico plans to challenge the raid at the World Court in The Hague.

Still, Noboa's display of force quickly earned him praise at home.

“I am in favor of President Noboa’s actions. I think it is a courageous act ... and I think it is going to strengthen him,” college professor Gabriela Sandoval said. “The priority is to clean, sanitize, continue with a process as important as President Noboa's to put the house in order.”

Ecuadorians will vote for president in February. Noboa is eligible to run for reelection.

Confidence in Noboa is such that business groups think the global condemnation of the raid will not impact commerce or the already thorny trade agreement negotiations between Ecuador and Mexico, which represent a key barrier to Ecuador's interest in joining Latin America's Pacific Alliance trade bloc.

“These political and current issues will somehow pass, and then, relations will go back to normal,” said Roberto Aspiazu, vice president of the Binational Ecuador-Mexico Chamber. “Sooner or later, that trade agreement is also going to be a reality because the negotiation is there and must be resumed at some point.”

Still, the timing of the diplomatic breakdown with Mexico could be particularly unfortunate for Ecuador and counterproductive for Noboa’s crimefighting ambitions, said Will Freeman, a fellow of Latin American studies at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

Ecuador was one of the calmest countries in Latin America until about four years ago, when Mexican and Colombian cartels expanded their established Ecuadorian operations, settling into coastal cities and exploiting world-class ports to ship hundreds of millions of dollars of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru.

“Ecuadorian gangs are criminal powers in their own right, but they have brokered alliances with Mexico’s Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation Cartel cartels,” Freeman said. “In an ideal world, Noboa would seek out the Mexican government’s cooperation to combat the gangs and their international partners, but clearly, with the break in diplomatic relations, that’s not happening.”

And though it remains unclear whether Noboa expected the global pushback his decision received, some of that criticism might weigh more heavily than others.

The U.S., which during Noboa's administration has supplied Ecuador with crucial equipment and training to combat the drug cartels, reiterated the importance of complying with international law following last week's raid.

“The United States takes very seriously the obligation of host countries under international law to respect diplomatic missions,” said Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. “We encourage Ecuador and Mexico to resolve their difference amicably.”

(AP) — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Monday upheld two first-degree murder convictions of a man found guilty in a 2009 double homicide case.

Robert Chavez was convicted in 2022 in the killings of Max Griego Jr. and Mary Hudson Gutierrez and sentenced to two consecutive life prison sentences.

Chavez appealed the sentences to the state’s high court, saying there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the murders based on uncorroborated testimony from accomplices. His team also argued that the district court erred when it used segments of his recorded jail telephone calls as evidence.

But the Supreme Court ruled the accomplice testimony was corroborated, there was sufficient evidence to convict Chavez and the district court didn’t abuse its discretion in its evidentiary rulings.

Chavez’s sentences are running consecutive with previous sentences, including a 26-year prison term for drug trafficking and life in prison plus 21 years for another murder.

Prosecutors said Chavez was the leader of the “AZ Boys,” an organization allegedly connected to drug trafficking.

Court records show Griego and Hudson Gutierrez were found fatally shot in July 2009 at a home in Alamogordo, a small town about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of the border. Two men plus a driver were seen fleeing the scene, according to the documents.

The case went cold for almost a decade until Chavez and two other suspects were indicted in January 2019.

(AP) — Tennessee's GOP-dominant Senate on Monday unanimously signed off on legislation requiring minors to have parental consent to create social media accounts.

The bill is similar to pushes currently being made across the United States as concern grows over young people's internet usage. Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Utah have all passed measures requiring parental consent for children to use social media — though Arkansas' version is currently blocked as a federal lawsuit makes its way through court. Georgia sent a proposal to Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature or veto last month.

The Tennessee Senate approved its version without debate, though lawmakers tacked on a last-minute addition to clarify the bill only applied to social media websites. That means the House chamber must approve those changes before it can go to Gov. Bill Lee's desk for his approval.

To comply with federal regulation, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms, but children have been shown to easily evade the restrictions.

However, Tennessee lawmakers are hoping to require social media companies to provide parents with options to view privacy settings, set daily time restrictions and implement mandatory breaks.

If enacted, the attorney general would be permitted to investigate and sue a social media platform for possible violations.

Up to 95% of teens aged 13 to 17 report using a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use them “almost constantly,” the Pew Research Center found.

""I want people who read this book to believe in themselves the way we did. I want you to trust you can bake amazing bread at home and maybe even turn it into a business, like we did.""

Russell and partner Mia opened Baker Blue in Melbourne in 2016 with no employees and Mia still working to support them.

""It was just the two of us. Literally, I’d bake, Mia would serve, we’d clean everything down and do it again the next day. We had our life savings, three bread recipes and nothing else. But we were hungry to do something of our own.""

Russell did not have a straightforward journey to baking, spending most of his 20s in search of the thing that ""made me tick"" and trying to avoid a 9 to 5 job.

""I wanted to do something that lit me up.""

He found it when he discovered baking. It began visiting Spain and Argentina and their food cultures where great bread was the vehicle for many different things. Then while working for Rockpool Bar and Grill he learned to make everything from brioche to cookies and cold desserts and it emphasised that all he wanted to do was bake bread.

""I loved baking bread because it was making something from start to end. It was a craft that had been practised for centuries using the same basic elements: flour, water, heat, time. And yet every time you did it, you were back at square one, no matter how many years you’d been baking. A baker is only as good as his last loaf.""

He baked at home following a 24-hour loaf recipe and was blown away by the fact such good results could come from such a simple method that could easily slot into a person’s routine.

His new obsession grew into a vocation and he took jobs in several top bakeries in Sydney and Melbourne.

""Making sourdough bread or yeasted Italian doughs, handshaping and crafting croissants and working at a much larger scale pushed me. But I couldn’t stop thinking and talking about bread.""

Despite his chequered employment past - writing advertising, washing dishes and waiting tables, looked into pig farming and cider brewing, studied pastry - he felt bread making was going to stick.

Five years later the pair opened their first bakery three days a week, selling three things - bagels, baguettes and a 2kg country loaf. Four years after that, Mia left her part-time job and they have moved into much bigger premises.

They have also opened a bakery in Sydney right next door to Nigel Perry’s Margaret and now they employ more than 80 people.

The book includes plenty of advice on tools and ingredients as well as recipes for making a sourdough starter, country loaves, ciabatta, bagels, challah, brioche and pies and cookies. He also includes recipes for ways to serve the bread - in tapas and sandwiches.

The Book

These crackers from Lilli Reed, our manager in Melbourne, have become a staple grocery item sold in our bakeries in Melbourne and Sydney. The idea came from all the excess seeds that fall off our seeded ficelles, bagels and loaves.

We store the seeds collected from our bread crates, mix through fresh seeds and add oats and other ingredients on hand at the bakery to make these delicious, healthy and moreish crackers. They make the perfect vehicle for cheese or avocado, and are a lighter replacement for bread.

Makes about 40 crackers

Ingredients

230g multi-seed mix (see below)

115g pepitas (pumpkin seeds)

25g chia seeds

35g psyllium husk

170g oats

530g filtered water, at 28°C

50g maple syrup

15g olive oil

Method

Mix all the dry ingredients together. Place the wet ingredients in a large bowl, mix well, then add the dry ingredients. Combine all the ingredients with your hands, making sure everything is really well incorporated. Cover and leave to rest for 2 hours in the fridge.

While the cracker mix is resting, prepare your baking paper. You’ll need two pieces of baking paper per tray, cut to the same size as each tray. Brush each sheet with a thin layer of oil.

Heat the oven to 170°C. Remove the cracker mix from the fridge and weigh out 170g portions, placing each on a sheet of baking paper. Cover with a second sheet of baking paper and roll out to a thickness of about 3mm. Peel off the top sheet of baking paper and slide the rolled cracker, still on its sheet of baking paper, on to a baking tray.

Use your dough scraper to score the cracker mix into your desired cracker size. We suggest scoring in half lengthways and then making four or five scores the other way. Repeat rolling and scoring until you’ve used all of the cracker mix.

Bake trays, in batches, for 15 minutes, then rotate them 180 degrees, reduce heat to 150°C , and bake for a further 30 minutes until crisp and dry. Repeat with remaining trays.

Remove crackers from oven, allow to cool, then divide into portions along the scoring marks.

Multi-seed mix

This is our go-to when we want to introduce flavour to anything: pastry, bread, pizza, cheesy dishes, even salads ... The secret to the flavour of this mix might lie in the unhulled sesame seeds.

Why hulled sesame seeds even exist is a mystery to Mia and me. Hulling removes flavour and fibre. Always seek out unhulled seeds.

Makes 700g

Ingredients

200g unhulled sesame seeds

200g linseeds

150g caraway seeds

100g poppy seeds

50g sea salt flakes (we like to use Tasman)

Method

Mix all the seeds and the salt flakes in a bowl with a wooden spoon.

Store in an airtight container for several weeks.

If you’re using this in a salad or to top a soup, you can toast the mix in a hot pan for a few minutes before using.

I’ve suggested making this pie with a lid, but there’s no reason why you can’t use a lattice pattern on top here.

Makes 2 x 18cm pies

Ingredients

970g rhubarb, leaves trimmed, cut into 2.5cm pieces

270g raw sugar, plus extra for sprinkling

35g cornflour (cornstarch)

3g fine salt

1 quantity of khorasan pie dough, formed into a shell, with lid or strips (see below)

1 egg, lightly beaten

Method

Combine the rhubarb and raw sugar in a large mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, drain the liquid from the rhubarb into a saucepan, reserving ¼ cup (60ml) in a separate bowl. Add the cornflour and salt to this reserved rhubarb liquid and mix with a spoon to create a slurry.

Place the saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the liquid warms to around 80°C , then stir in the cornflour slurry and return to a simmer, simmering gently until the mixture is clear and thickened.

Remove from the heat, add the rhubarb pieces and stir to coat, then cool to room temperature.

Heat the oven to 170°C. Add the cooled filling to the unbaked pie shell.

Place the circular lid on top, crimping the edge where the two pieces of pastry meet.

Brush the lid with the beaten egg, then sprinkle the whole top of the pie generously with raw sugar. Finally, cut a hole in the centre (about 1cm) with a small, sharp knife to allow steam to escape while the pie bakes.

Bake for 50–60 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for about 1 hour. Remove from the tin and cool on a wire cooling rack for a further 10 minutes before serving.

Sweet khorasan pie dough

2 pie tins, 18cm in diameter

One of the golden rules of making shortcrust pastry such as this is to avoid overdeveloping the dough, otherwise you won’t get the flakiness that makes it so desirable. Apple-cider vinegar is your secret weapon in achieving that texture. It has a counteractive effect on gluten development, so will prevent any toughness from creeping in. More importantly, it also adds a lovely tart edge to sweet items. With the nutty flavour of the khorasan, you’ll find this recipe tastes a little different from your average shortcrust; although we use it for pies, it’s also a great base for sable biscuits and tarts, including chocolate or caramel.

A couple of things to keep in mind: it’s really crucial that you have large, almost coin-sized, shards of butter through the dough. Then when you’re mixing the dough, bring it just beyond still being raggedy and falling apart - overmixing destroys the flakiness you get from the big pieces of butter.

Ingredients

460g Unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing

200g Filtered water

770g Khorasan flour or baker’s flour will also give a fine result.

8g Fine pink salt

20g Apple-cider vinegar

115 Raw sugar, plus extra for sprinkling

Method

Your first priority is to chill all the ingredients that need to be cold. Dice the butter into roughly 2cm cubes, then place it in the fridge for 40 minutes to 1 hour (if you’re short on time, you can get away with half that time). Measure the water into a large jug and also place it in the fridge.

Add the flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Add the chilled butter and begin to combine things by squeezing the butter and dry ingredients together with your fingertips. The flour will start to coat the butter and, after a couple of minutes, the whole mix will start to look shaggy. It’s important not to overmix the dough, so keep an eye on things; when it’s ready, you should be able to see discs of butter coated in flour.

Remove the chilled water from the fridge. Add the vinegar and sugar to the water and whisk them all together thoroughly so the sugar dissolves.

Create a well in the centre of your shaggy flour-butter mix, and pour in half the vinegar mixture. Start to incorporate the shaggy dough with your hand, working first in the centre, then slowly working outwards towards the edge of the bowl. As a dough begins to form, gradually add the rest of the liquid. You may not need it all; this is a dough that should look on the dry side, but once you bake it, the coarse bits of butter will release moisture, so it’s better to add less liquid now. It should still look scraggly.

Once the pastry has just come together (again, avoid overmixing), you should be able to see the shards of butter in it. This will be your flakiness. Form the dough into a loose rectangle, cover well with plastic wrap or a bag and refrigerate for 1 hour to rest.

Remove the dough from the fridge, dust your bench with flour and, with the longest side facing you, start rolling out the dough with a floured rolling pin or wine bottle. Continue rolling until you start to see the edge of the dough form cracks. As soon as this happens, rotate the dough 90 degrees.

Continue with this rolling and rotating method until you’ve rolled the dough to 3mm thick. As you’re rolling, make sure that the dough isn’t sticking to the bench and that it’s not getting sticky or warm on your rolling pin. If it is, transfer it to the freezer on a tray for a few minutes (no more than 5 minutes), to firm back up.

Once the dough is rolled out, take your pie tin and place it upside down on top of the dough to use as a cutting guide. Cut around the pie tin with a sharp knife, ensuring you’ve added 2.5 cm of buffer around the circumference to allow for shrinkage. You should easily get two pie cases out of this recipe, or you can make a lid or a lattice.

To make a lid, roll about 200g of pastry to 2mm thickness, in a circular shape. Place an empty pie tin on your pastry (right-way up) and cut around it like a template, then take this piece of dough, put it on a tray and place it in the fridge to chill for 20 minutes.

To cut strips for a lattice, gather up the dough scraps and form them into a ball, then chill for 5 minutes in the freezer (if you’re baking the same day; otherwise freeze it and thaw before use). Roll out the scraps into a rectangle, 3mm thick. With a sharp knife, cut strips about 2.5cm wide and set aside, covered with a tea towel.

Set the pie shell(s) and/or the lid aside (if you’ve made two shells and don’t want to bake two pies now, freeze one shell).

Heat the oven to 170°C. Grease the inside of your pie tin (I like to use the packaging that’s left over from the diced butter). Line the tin with one of the pastry shells, pushing it into the edges gently with your thumbs, then gently up against the walls of the tin. At this point you can leave the pie shell in the fridge overnight (covered) if you like and you can roll out and cut the lattice the next day.

Fill the pie with your chosen filling. Follow above recipe.

We love the pistachios that we get from Eric Wright at Go Just Nuts, grown on a farm in sunny Mildura, hundreds of kilometres north of Melbourne. He brines his pistachios so they’re super crunchy. These cookies show them off fabulously.

Makes 20

Ingredients

220g plain (all-purpose) flour

80g rye flour

5g baking powder

8g bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)

8g fine salt

135g unsalted butter, at room temperature

105g pistachio paste (see note)

265g soft brown sugar

65g caster (superfine) sugar

65g eggs (about 1½)

40g egg yolks (from about 2½ eggs)

95g white chocolate, roughly chopped

95g dried cherries, roughly chopped

195g shelled unsalted pistachio nuts, roughly chopped

Method

Place the flours, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a large bowl and combine with a whisk. Set aside.

Place the butter, pistachio paste, brown sugar and caster sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream the ingredients on medium speed for 5 minutes until light and fluffy.

Switch to low speed and add the whole eggs and yolks in two batches, scraping down the sides of the bowl and making sure the first batch is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix until all the egg is incorporated.

Add the bowl of dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined.

Add the white chocolate, cherries and 95g of the pistachios and mix briefly until evenly distributed.

Use a spoon or quarter-cup to scoop out pieces of the cookie dough about 60g in weight. Roll each piece into a ball, then press to flatten into discs.

Place the discs on baking trays or in a proofing tray lined with baking paper and cover with a tea towel or a lid, then refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to rest.

Half an hour before baking, heat the oven to 180°C and spread the remaining 100g of chopped pistachios on to a plate or baking sheet.

Remove the cookies from the fridge 10 minutes before baking. Press one side of each cookie into the chopped pistachios, then place the cookies on to a baking tray lined with baking paper (you may need a few trays) about 5cm apart, with the nuts facing up.

Bake for 7 minutes, at which point remove the trays from the oven and gently tap them on a bench before placing them back in the oven for a final 3 minutes or so until the cookies are browned around the edges. (The tapping will give you nice flat cookies with a chewy texture.)

Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the trays for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Cookies will keep in a sealed container at room temperature for 3–4 days.

Note

Pistachio paste should be 100% pure pistachio butter. Read the ingredients list carefully. It can be bought from health food shops or specialist baking shops.","Make it, bake it","I want you to trust you can bake amazing bread at home and maybe even turn it into a business, like we did.""

A judge in Argentina has ruled that two bishops and two priests are liable for gender-based discrimination and violence toward a group of Discalced Carmelite nuns.

Judge Carolina Cáceres Moreno ruled on 4 April that the cloistered nuns of the Monastery of St Bernard in Salta were subjected to psychological, verbal and physical abuse by Archbishop Mario Cargnello of Salta, Bishop Emeritus Martín de Elizalde of Nueve de Julio, Fr Ignacio Loyola Pinto de Sancristóval and Fr Lucio Ajaya.

Cáceres ordered the four accused clergymen to undergo psychological treatment and training “in order to modify their behavioural patterns”, and said the Pope must be notified of the court’s decision.

The complaint filed by the nuns said that they had endured “sustained harassment over time that began in 1999”, the year Archbishop Cargnello was appointed to the archdiocese.

“I conclude and affirm that the Carmelites have suffered acts of gender violence in the institutional sphere of the religious, physical, psychological and economic type for a period of more than 20 years,” the Cáceres said in her ruling.

Lawyers representing the Archdiocese of Salta said they would appeal the decision. They said that the case has no merit given the fact that “the judge has repeatedly sent the case to the criminal prosecutor”, who has refused to pursue it.

The Archdiocese of Salta has been in conflict with the Discalced Carmelite community over the latter’s support of alleged Marian apparitions of in Salta.

In 2022, following a request by Archbishop Cargnello, the Vatican appointed Bishop Elizalde to conduct an apostolic visitation of the monastery.

In a statement published in April that year, the archdiocese said the Vatican offered instructions regarding the monastery’s administrative management as well as affirming that it was subject to obedience to the archbishop.

It also determined that the convent’s support of the alleged apparitions in Salta, including allowing the supposed visionary Maria Livia Galliano to live at the monastery property, “went against the will of the local church”.",Argentine bishops judged guilty of ‘gender violence’ against nuns,"Archbishop Mario Antonio Cargnello of Salta was appointed in 1999, when the nuns say the “harassment” began.

The most striking response in Latin America came from fascistic President Javier Milei of Argentina, who created a Crisis Committee composed of cabinet members and the Israeli ambassador in Buenos Aires, Eyal Sela.

Milei cut short a trip to Denmark, where his government bought F-16 fighter jets, and returned to Buenos Aires, “to take charge of the situation and coordinate actions with the presidents of the Western world,” according to his spokesperson.

The Milei administration recently committed to a “strategic alliance” with the Pentagon and formally requested Thursday to become a NATO “global partner,” a status held only by Colombia in the region. After Milei visited Israel to back its genocide in Gaza, CIA director William Burns and then US Southern Command chief Laura Richardson made visits to Argentina.

Now, Milei is using the Israeli aggression against Iran to cement his regime’s role as cockpit for US imperialist conspiracies in the region, clearly aspiring to the role played by Israel in the Middle East.

Giving an indication of what was being concocted by the “Crisis Committee,” Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich went on national television to claim, without a shred of evidence, that there are 700 members of Iran’s Quds Force in Bolivia, suggesting they are being given Bolivian passports.

Argentina and Ecuador were the only two Latin American countries to sign a US-led statement issued on Wednesday denouncing “unequivocally” Iran’s attack on Israel. Such condemnations are a sign of total subservience to US imperialism and its hypocrisy, with Washington having long asserted its right to slaughter whomever it considers an obstacle to its interests.

Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa separately declared, “Ecuador’s full support to the people of Israel in these difficult times.” His vice president, Verónica Abad, is currently in Israel as part of a so-called “Peace Mission.”

Chile’s pseudo-left President Gabriel Boric, who also supports the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine, issued a separate but equally subservient statement “condemning Iran’s missile and drone attacks on Israel.”

In Venezuela, several right-wing media outlets have made unfounded claims that the Nicolas Maduro administration was directly complicit in the Iranian attack. Meanwhile, the US-backed opposition has used the Iranian attack to promote regime change.

Fascistic opposition leader María Corina Machado declared: “This unprecedented and unacceptable action once again raises our denunciation of the risk represented by Iran’s alliance with the Venezuelan regime... Venezuela’s return to democracy and its reinsertion into the free world will contribute to mitigating this risk.”

Maduro blamed the Iran-Israel conflict on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “US support,” and warned: “An escalation of the conflict, a product of Netanyahu’s Nazi madness, could lead us to a third world war, and Venezuela advocates peace, rationality, diplomacy and truth.”

This followed the decision by White House officials to reimpose full sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports, after failing to strong arm the Maduro regime into allowing Washington’s preferred candidate, Corina Machado, to run in the presidential elections planned for July. At the same time, the US has continued to give separate licenses to US-based oil companies “on a case-by-case basis,” establishing an effective stranglehold on Venezuela’s most important source of income.

But having denounced Washington for supporting fascism and provoking a Third World War, Maduro also said on Monday that he will “never close the door on dialogue.”

“I told negotiators to give President Biden the following message ‘If you want, I want. If you don’t want, I don’t want,’” he said in broken English.

In a press briefing, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Iran’s attack was a response to Israel’s bombing of the Iranian embassy and asked Israel not to retaliate. “It’s going to be escalating the conflict to a very risky situation,” he said.

His administration has refused to condemn any side—including Israel for the Gaza genocide and its provocative aggression against Iran— and proposed “more UN activity” for “peace” and “universal fraternity.”

In Brazil, President Lula da Silva, who was declared a “persona non grata” by Israel after he likened the slaughter in Gaza to the Holocaust, merely called for all sides to avoid escalation. According to O Globo, his government is using diplomatic channels to advocate against an Israeli reprisal.

Lula has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza but, like López Obrador, has upheld Israel’s supposed “right of self-defense” and promoted the moribund “two-state solution,” which has historically served as a fraudulent cover for the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.

The Bolivian government of President Luis Arce, who had broken diplomatic relations with Israel over its genocide in Gaza, responded to the Iranian attack by calling on the UN to intervene, and warning that “escalating global violence puts humanity at risk of extinction.”

Colombia’s pseudo-left President Gustavo Petro similarly warned: “It was foreseeable; we are now on the verge of World War III... The US support, in practice, for genocide has set the world ablaze.” Petro has, notwithstanding, vowed to “consolidate” his government’s status as a “NATO global partner” and had no better proposal than to ask the UN to “to bet immediately on Peace.”

The Middle East crisis has once again exposed the United Nations as a “thieves’ kitchen” at the service of imperialism and a “lie from beginning to end,” as Lenin described its predecessor, the League of Nations. It has not only failed to stop any of the US-led wars of aggression globally since its creation but has actively provided a pseudo-legal cover for many of them.

While Latin America’s far-right regimes act as provocateurs in direct coordination with the CIA, the supposed “anti-imperialist” and “pacifist” policies of the “pink tide” governments are entirely bankrupt, reduced to a futile bid to pressure the imperialist powers to be less predatory.

Lula, AMLO, Maduro and company represent the interests of sections of the bourgeoisie which are trying to leverage trade and diplomatic ties with China, Russia, and, to a lesser extent, Iran. Their alarm over a potential nuclear world war is all the more significant given their unconditional defense of capitalism and ultimate subordination to imperialism.

Economic globalization and the weakened hegemony of US imperialism have made Latin America a key battleground in the new redivision of the planet. For Washington, the region’s strategic natural resources and supply chains for key US industries, including arms manufacturers, must be secured from Chinese and even European rivals. Moreover, it finds it necessary to draw the larger militaries (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Chile), whose forces and influence it has long cultivated, actively into its warring camp.

Recently announcing the deployment of the US 4th Fleet with the aircraft carrier USS George Washington in joint exercises and operations across South America, the Pentagon boasted that its sailors “are ready to control the sea, conduct strikes, and maneuver across the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace.”",Latin America drawn into Middle East conflict amid warnings of “Third World War”,"The Israeli-provoked military conflict with Iran is dragging Latin America further into the spiral of an emerging world war.

Deaf believers lifted hands to sign “My Savior, God to thee, how great Thou Art.” The diverse group of worshipers praised in styles unique to their culture. Their praise, however, was joined to honor one God and their reason to gather was for one purpose — to ask God to send more missionaries from all nations to all nations.

Close to 330 participants representing 76 countries met in Asia for the first Global Senders Forum on April 16-19. The International Mission Board hosted the event but shared leadership responsibilities with other Baptist and like-minded sending organizations. Large delegations from Brazil, South Korea and Taiwan joined single representatives from other countries. National Baptist leaders, heads of conventions, seminary presidents and agency directors joined IMB missionaries and national partners to discuss the growth of their unity in fulfilling the Great Commission.

“We gather this week to explore how we can work closely together to change the reality of growing lostness in the world,” said IMB President Paul Chitwood. “This meeting is a historical first for us. Never in our 179-year history have we convened a meeting of leaders representing more than one-third of the countries on the planet to impact lostness together.”

Chitwood, who sent personal invitations to many of the leaders, said, “You honor me by gathering here. You bless me.”

Historic gathering

IMB leaders have long dreamed of an event like this that gathers missionary senders from around the world, said Amanda Davis who directs globalization efforts for the Southern Baptist agency. The first official plans for an event in 2020 were sidetracked because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“Now we’re rejoicing that the time has finally come,” Davis said. “This really is an historic gathering where global senders will teach each other and encourage each other and pray for each other.

“Some of these participants realize they have traditionally been receivers of missionaries. Now they know they must be missionary senders if the Great Commission is going to be fulfilled. We are all a part of the body of Christ, and each group has unique gifts and resources we all must share and steward for the sake of the Gospel and for the glory of God. We can do more together! We are eager to see what God will do among global Baptists because of this gathering.”

Many of the visiting Baptists can trace their Christian roots to the missionary efforts of Southern Baptists. Today they are owning the strategies for not only reaching their own people groups but sending missionaries to other nations. Attendees offered private and public thanks to the IMB for its long history of commitment to reach the uttermost parts of the world.

Chitwood said, “Southern Baptists in the U.S. will be encouraged to know that work started in 1845 to reach the nations is now being carried out in scores of nations around the world by national believers and is stronger because of it. The countries of Africa are uniting to send missionaries. Brazil currently has 4,000 missionaries serving in 87 countries, and Korean Baptists remain one of our strongest partners in the missionary task as they send thousands of missionaries.

“We cannot stop sending missionaries from the U.S., but believers around the world are saying the same thing, ‘we are stronger together.’”

Multiple nations

IMB leaders asked hotel staff to remove idols and religious icons, common in the host culture, from the main conference room. Statues and the lingering scent of burning incense remained in other parts of the hotel and surrounding area, reminding attendees of the lostness that brought them together.

The four-day event included plenary sessions, breakouts, worship and time for networking and fellowship. Main sessions were led by leaders representing the regions and countries of participants. The hum of translators broadcasting into earpieces provided a white noise behind the voice of speakers. Main sessions were translated into Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesian, French, Chinese, Korean, Russian, English and multiple sign languages.

Musicians from multiple countries led in worship and encouraged participants to sing familiar songs in their own languages. During a prayer time led by Deaf attendees, pastor Ondrej Klofac from the Czech Republic, asked the crowd to leave their eyes open. “Eyes are important to us,” he signed, referring to the Deaf community. “Pray with me as I talk to my Lord.” Klofac serves as a Deaf church planter in Europe.

Afternoons included breakouts on topics such as engaging Muslims with the Gospel, raising next generations to embrace missions and ministry during political upheaval. Some countries shared specifics about their sending agencies. Networking included times to discuss needs for sending and receiving missionaries, designed for countries to understand how best to serve one another.

Global vision

Throughout the event, the message of unity was repeated. Fernando Brandao, president of the National Mission Board of the Brazilian Baptist Convention, excitedly reminded the crowd to unify through the power of the Holy Spirit. Barely pausing to allow his interpreter to catch up, he said, “We all have the same purpose — reach everyone, everywhere.”

He added, “We cannot retreat because we must reach all nations. And we must do it together!”

Africans on Mission, a new missionary sending agency, exemplified the strength of unity and the growth of the Church in African countries. Mamitiana Nirintsoa, pastor in Madagascar and chair of Africans on Mission, explained that for centuries Africa has only been considered a mission field. Today, Africans are crossing cultural boundaries between their own countries and tribes to unify around obedience to the Great Commission.

“We are the baby in this room,” Nirintsoa said of the group that held their first official meeting in February. “Yet we are ready to send missionaries, to cooperate with you to send missionaries from Africa to Africa and beyond.”

Rehabeam Auala of Namibia echoed the beauty of diverse peoples united around the cause of Christ. “That’s at the center of what [Africans on Mission] stands for,” he said. “[We are] finding the common belief and commitment to spread the Gospel to the world.

“We serve a faithful God who is capable of the impossible. It’s not of man. It’s not of us. It’s not of the continent. It’s of Him,” Auala concluded.

The event ended with a time of commitment. Fifty-nine organizations submitted written commitments, many of which were shared publicly. Some conventions or agencies had specific commitments to send more missionaries. For example, a team from Paraguay committed to send three families beyond its border by 2030. The Togo Baptist Convention committed to send seven more home missionaries and seven more international missionaries by 2025. Others committed to increase mission awareness in churches, training or prayer for more missionaries from their people group. One collective result was a commitment of 1,056 new missionaries over the next 10 years.

“This is only the beginning,” Davis said, summarizing the event. “The IMB has more steps to take toward a global vision of working together with other senders, and other nations also have further steps to take. The exciting part is that as we take steps toward each other, toward working together, we’re also leading others toward Christ and His eternal kingdom. As others have also said this week, this event has been a glimpse into the Revelation 7:9 vision.”

Davis said smaller follow-up globalization meetings are planned for the future. IMB leaders are hopeful that connections and relationships formed through this meeting will create organic networks and partnerships to carry on the vision to reach all nations, tribes, peoples and languages with the Gospel.

The request came as Nato’s deputy general secretary Mircea Geoana discussed regional security challenges with Argentine defence minister Luis Petri, who was visiting Brussels.

Mr Geoana said he welcomed Argentina’s bid to become an accredited partner in the alliance — a valued role short of “ally” for nations not in Nato’s geographical area and not required to participate in collective military actions.

Nato membership is currently limited to European countries, Turkey, Canada, and the United States.

The designation could allow Argentina access to advanced technology, security systems, and training that was not previously available to it, the Argentine presidency said.

“Argentina plays an important role in Latin America,” Mr Geoana said at the Nato headquarters.

“Closer political and practical cooperation could benefit us both.”

Mr Milei has been pushing a radical libertarian agenda aimed at reversing years of protectionist trade measures, overspending and crippling international debt that has plunged the country’s economy into a tailspin.

Over his past four months as president, he has reshaped Argentina’s foreign policy to almost unconditional support for the United States.

This is part of an effort to return Argentina to prominence in the global economy after past administrations allowed relations with Washington and European allies to wither.

Mr Milei’s government also seeks security benefits through warming ties with Western countries.

On Thursday, the US government announced it was providing Argentina with 40 million dollars (£32 million) in foreign military financing for the first time in more than two decades — a grant that allows key US allies like Israel to buy American weaponry.

The funds, intended to help Argentina equip and modernise its military, will help foot the bill for 24 American F-16 fighter aircraft Argentina bought from Denmark earlier this week.

Defence minister Mr Petri hailed the acquisition of the advanced warplanes as “the most important military purchase since Argentina’s return to democracy” in 1983. The 300 million dollar (£241 million) price tag has drawn criticism from Mr Milei’s political opponents as he slashes spending across the government.

Formally partnering with Nato requires the consensus of all 32 Nato members.

Argentina’s ties to key Nato ally Britain have been fraught since 1982 when the two went to war over the contested Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.

Resize text - + =

I did several interviews today, but I am only posting the roundtable with Judge Napolitano and Ray McGovern and my chat with Ania, which contains a segment on Argentina.

The descent of the United States into an authoritarian state intent on controlling speech and punishing political opponents kicked off our conversation with the Judge. I think the Israeli/Zionist movement is in trouble. According to Haaretz, reports that the International Criminal Court is preparing indictments against Netanyahu and two of his government ministers has set off a panic in the Israeli Government and is forcing some changes in the conduct of the genocidal operation in Gaza:

Whether or not the arrest warrants materialize, they have already had an effect. It is impossible to detach them from the postponement of any move to start the evacuation of Palestinian civilians as a prelude to the Rafah operation, and the sudden willingness of Netanyahu to accept an Egyptian proposal for a hostage agreement that will include the restoration of freedom of movement in Gaza and, more than anything else, the increasingly open actions by Israel to restore supply lines into Gaza after long months of obstruction. Israeli officials admit that these are now directly connected to the government’s urgent efforts to fend off arrest warrants. It’s part of a wider trend of belated realization that the costs of this war on the international front could become intolerable, whether for Israel as a country or for certain Israeli individuals. And while many, perhaps even a majority, of Israelis don’t particularly care if Netanyahu (and Mrs. Netanyahu) might have to give up his penchant for state-funded travel overseas, this isn’t just about him.

I think this is one reason Israel has delayed, if not postponed, its previously announced plan to launch a major cleansing of Rafah.

Along with the specter of ICC arrest warrants, Israel is becoming more isolated diplomatically and economically. Colombia, which traditionally has sided with Israel has broken off relations. Turkey’s Erdogan has now put some meat into his previously empty bombast by suspending trade with Israel. I think oil is still flowing, but that supply could be stopped if Israel goes forward with the Rafah operation.

One topic that the Israeli media is ignoring is the economic pain Israel is suffering as a result of its Gaza campaign. The workforce has been savaged because Palestinian workers are no longer allowed in Israel and Israeli reservists are on active duty instead of doing their civilian jobs. This is all just a reminder that war is not just about killing the “enemy.” There are political and economic considerations as well and Israel has made a mess of those. The global student protests against Israel’s slaughter of Palestinian civilians are gaining traction. It is not confined to the United States.

The chat with Ania took an unexpected but welcomed turn when she asked me about Argentina. While it has been more than 20 years since my last visit to Buenos Aires and Cordoba, the economic chaos that has saddled Argentina for the last 40 years continues. I am particularly amused by President Javier Millei’s reported request to have Argentina join NATO. What a chiste (joke in Spanish)! Last I checked, the Argentine people still insist that Las Malvinas Son Nuestras (i.e., the Falkland Islands are ours). Perhaps Millei does not realize that the United Kingdom still claims the Falklands as its sovereign territory and also happens to be part of NATO. I do not anticipate any enthusiasm on the part of the Brits to welcome the diminutive Argentine leader into the NATO club anytime soon.

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, the Russians are advancing and bombing the daylights out of Ukrainian command centers, power plants and military storage facilities. And Western leaders, especially the Brits and the French, are becoming more shrill and desperate with each passing day. Britain’s goof of a Foreign Minister put his foot deep inside his mouth today with his reckless call for Ukraine to attack inside Russia with British Storm Shadow missiles. That’s real smart. Commit an overt act of war against Russia and expect the Russians to do nothing? As they say in the southern states of the United States, that dog won’t hunt.

Things to keep in mind...

Neo-Nazi ideology has become one of the main protagonists of political and social life in Ukraine since the 2014 coup d'état. Meanwhile, fascist ideology and blatant lies also permeate the consciousness of most people in the West. Those in the comfortable top 10%, the ""PMCs"" (Professional Managerial Class), are especially vulnerable. They support and disseminate such ideas. They are the executors of the actual ruling class' orders, those in the 0.001%, who remain largely invisible. The PMCs are the political class, the media whores, the top military brass, some people in academia, and the ""national security/foreign policy"" industry honchos. Push back against these unethical, contaminated people with the truth while you can.

According to a report by Italian outlet Tutto Mercato Web, Matias Soule is the subject of interest from Aston Villa. The Villans are scouring the market for an offensive reinforcement heading into the summer transfer window. They have approached Serie A club Juventus to ask for information about the 21-year-old winger, who will cost around €30 million.

Matias Soule and his Frosinone loan

Matias Soule has benefitted from joining Frosinone on loan from Juventus last summer. A native of Mar del Plata, the Argentine attacker spent most of his formative years in his homeland before arriving in Europe in January 2020. Since then, he has come leaps and bounds in Italy.

The 21-year-old rose through the ranks at Juventus before breaking into the first-team squad. However, with regular game time coming at a premium, the Bianconeri loaned him out to fellow Serie A club Frosinone last summer. And Soule has enjoyed a solid campaign with Frosinone, amassing 11 goals and three assists in 33 appearances across all competitions.

Meanwhile, Soule’s progress has not gone unnoticed, with several well-known clubs across Europe setting their sights on him. The youngster’s next destination might be the Premier League, with Aston Villa among his prospective suitors heading into the summer transfer window.

Aston Villa interested

Aston Villa’s interest in Matias Soule is understandable. While the Villans signed Morgan Rogers in the winter transfer window to bolster their offensive department, they can do with another attacker this summer. Aston Villa will likely part ways with a few underperforming players in the summer transfer window.

So, Soule is a viable target to bolster the offensive department in the coming months. And Aston Villa recently approached Juventus to ask for information about the Argentine winger. The report adds that the 21-year-old will cost around €30 million.

Aston Villa’s financially stable situation means they should be in the position to cough up €30 million to secure Matias Soule’s services. With Nicolo Zaniolo unlikely to complete a permanent move to Villa Park, Soule can be the ideal candidate to replace the Italian international.",Aston Villa ask for information about Matias Soule,"Aston Villa recently approached Juventus to ask for information about 21-year-old Argentine winger Matias Soule, valued at €30 million.

OAK ISLAND — Earlier this week, multiple lightning strikes affected area structures within minutes of each other after a storm rolled through Oak Island.

On Wednesday, May 8, Oak Island Fire Department was first dispatched just after 9 p.m. to a lightning strike that hit a home on NE 4th Street. The structure endured property damage but it did not result in a fire.

During this response, crews also were dispatched to an active fire at 302 W. Yacht Dr. It was 75% involved in fire and crews deployed engines and ladder units to contain it. They succeeded within 45 minutes and no secondary structures surrounding it were damaged.

Upon working the fire on Yacht Drive, another call came in about a home that also sustained lightning strike damage, though it wasn’t involved in a fire.

Multiple crews were able to help the local fire department, as the calls came in within a seven-block radius of one another. This included Oak Island Police Department, Bolivia Fire Department, Brunswick County EMS, Southport Fire Department, St. James Fire Department, Sunny Point Fire & Rescue, Sunset Harbor Zion Hill Volunteer fire Department, Winnabow Volunteer Fire Department, with standby assistance provided by Leland Fire Department and Supply Volunteer Fire Department.

With summer fast approaching, the Public Safety Commission voted to have the temporary impound yard at Malibu High School. Last summer, the lower parking lot adjacent to Morning View Drive was used to facilitate towing of illegally parked vehicles in Malibu while the city has been trying to find a permanent location.

In 2022, the Malibu City Council decided to permit a temporary day-use impound yard on city-owned property situated at the intersection of Heathercliff Road and PCH. The impound yard was used to facilitate towing of illegally parked vehicles in Malibu. Last year, the commission motioned to make MHS the temporary location. The item had to be approved by the Planning Commission, and Chair John Mazza raised concerns about the permits, planning coordination, and who would be liable if an accident were to occur on campus, in the school district, or in the city.

For staff updates, Public Safety Liaison Luis Flores provided an updated homeless services report and said two individuals experiencing homelessness had died this year. On March 29, one individual, identified as 32-year-old Dimitri Failla, was struck and killed by a semi-truck on Pacific Coast Highway near the intersection of Cross Creek Road. After the investigation, sheriff’s homicide detectives said the incident was a suicide.

On April 12, Russell McMonigle, 73, was found at Zuma Beach by an LA County Beaches and Harbor maintenance employee with a head injury and was pronounced deceased at the scene. According to Malibu/Lost Hills Sgt. Chris Soderlund, the medical examiner said the incident was a natural death. No evidence of foul play was found. Friends say McMonigle has been experiencing homelessness in Malibu for many years.

Malibu Community Labor Exchange Board President Kay Gabbard honored McMonigle during the City Council meeting last month.

“For 15 years we have watched Russell walk up and down Zuma picking up trash and treasures. The last six or seven years pushing or pulling various cards loaded with his current fully stocked belongings more and more hunch from arthritis and sleeping on hard, cold surfaces. ￼￼Many of us walked by him with a smile, some offered him food or a new cart, and listened to his stories,” Gabbard said. “He left us the day after our two outstanding People in Concern outreach workers took him to see the apartment that could be his in Santa Monica. He loved us knowing he had friends and was loved for who he was.”

Flores said McMonigle had been working with their outreach team and said he had searched for an apartment a day before he passed.

“It’s very unfortunate,” Flores said.

Flores said the lidar guns that were purchased by the city are being utilized by sheriff’s deputies to record hazardous driving behaviors in the city.

The commission received an update on construction and the upcoming Annual Safety and Preparedness Fair, which will take place on Saturday, Sept. 14. The city has also been hosting a series of safety and preparedness training and classes as part of their community-wide emergency preparedness. The city held two free classes in May on how to operate a fire extinguisher and safety considerations. For more information on classes and upcoming events, email Emergency Services Coordinator Sarah Flores at saflores@malibucity.org.

Public Works Director Rob DeBoux provided an update on PCH construction and projects by Caltrans. Topanga Canyon has been closed indefinitely since March 12.

Commissioner Josh Spiegel asked about the closure and asked, “Can we do anything to expedite that? Because there’s no way out.”

DeBoux said Caltrans is doing everything they can.

“We get updates every week on what they’re doing and they’re moving, they’re getting things done,” DeBoux said. “It’s a big slide, it’s a lot of work, so they’re doing everything they can to try to open up.”

The commission received an update on the temporary impound yard for this summer.

For public comment, Moshe Ben-dayan, owner of Tip-Top Towing, suggested the city create a parking location to assist with tow companies.

“It’s essential for business, I think it’s essential that every city needs, and I think The City of Malibu will need something there if you want to be efficient,” Ben-dayan said. “I can tell you that in no way, in my opinion, that the sheriff’s department can do their jobs properly if they have to wait for us an hour to an hour and a half to get there, so it’s definitely essential.”

Ben-dayan said they don’t keep vehicles for more than 72 hours and after that, they move them to Santa Monica.

Chair Chris Frost suggested using the lot at Heathercliff Road and PCH to park tow trucks.

In the summer, MHS parking will be used during summer months. Frost said on a recent Sunday, 350 tickets were cited, and 150 of those were for hazardous parking. After discussion, the commission suggested using the upper chili cook-off lot for a permanent tow yard.

Sgt. Chris Soderlund said the site would assist the sheriffs who have to wait for a tow truck to arrive.

“The way it’s been going now, a deputy has to wait an hour for a tow truck, you have six to seven deputies down here; that’s one deputy out of the field for an hour,” Soderlund said.

Spiegel voted in favor of parking the impounded cars at the chili cook-off site.

Coincidently, the city will host a community meeting on May 21, seeking feedback regarding the future use of five community lands. Over the next several months, the city will seek input from the Malibu community, including residents, businesses and community groups.

This meeting will provide background on following five vacant parcels of land:

Chili Cook-Off

Triangle

Heathercliff

Trancas

La Paz

The meeting is on Tuesday, May 21, from 6 to 7:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers at Malibu City Hall, located at 23825 Stuart Ranch Road, or via Zoom. For more information visit the city’s website at malibucommunitylands.org/events/community-meeting-1/.

“In the meantime, we need to take care of a safety problem in the city, this doesn’t have to be permanent 10 years from now, but we’ve got to do something soon to solve a problem we’ve got right now, and these properties all sit vacant,” Frost said. “So what happens five years or 10 years down the line will probably be completely different, but this shouldn’t affect that.”

Malibu Volunteers on Patrol Team Leader Mark Russo provided a brief update on the team and said they are constantly looking for volunteers. Russo said they currently have 19 volunteers.

Russo said year to date, they have written 5,300 citations, and in the month of April, they have written just as many cities as the first three months of the year.

“We see pressure at all the normal spots, Winding Ways, Point Dume obviously, we try to do as much as we can there,” he said. “It’s kind of an area where we have to keep someone devoted to just patrolling that area specifically.”

With staffing, “we’re always trying to recruit,” Russo said. “If people want to get involved, this is a great program to do it. Every one person helps, so we try to have someone every single day doing this.”

The next meeting is scheduled for June 5 at the City Hall Multipurpose Room.

At the end of last year, Urenco approved an investment to expand enrichment capacity at its facility in the Netherlands. Earlier in May, the UK government awarded £196 million ($245 million) to Urenco to build a new uranium enrichment facility at its Capenhurst site in northwest England.

Aside from Russia, other countries with enrichment capacity include Argentina, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, the Netherlands, North Korea, Pakistan, and the UK. Some are now seeking to expand their facilities.

Currently Russia is the world's only commercial source of the more highly enriched high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel that's needed for many of the small and advanced reactors now in the design stage.

Some providers in the US, with federal support, are in the process of producing HALEU. Under a 2019 contract with DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy, Centrus licensed and built a new cascade of 16 centrifuges at Piketon, Ohio, to demonstrate production of HALEU. The Piketon demonstration project last year produced its first amounts of HALEU for next-generation reactors, with plans to increase production to 900 kilograms in the near future. However, this is nowhere near enough to fill the gap that will be left if Russian supplies cease.

US officials have been upbeat about the ban. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the new law“re-establishes America's leadership in the nuclear sector. It will help secure our energy sector for generations to come. And – building off the unprecedented $2.72 billion in federal funding that Congress recently appropriated at the President's request – it will jump-start new enrichment capacity in the United States and send a clear message to industry that we are committed to long-term growth in our nuclear sector.”

Sullivan said the law also delivers on multilateral targets, including an announcement last year by the USA with Canada, France, Japan and the UK of plans to collectively invest $4.2 billion to expand their enrichment and conversion capacity.“With these funds from Congress, we have well-exceeded that pledge and are working with industry to realise this ambition,” Sullivan said.

DOE said the ban“brings us one step closer to developing a reliable supply of nuclear fuel that will be required by the United States and its allies to triple nuclear capacity by 2050, creating thousands of high-paying jobs along the way.”

However, even before the ban became law, concerns about fuel supplies were having an effect on the myriad of companies that have produced designs for small and advanced modular reactors, some with significant government support. Many companies have highly optimistic targets of deploying their first reactors by 2030, although most are still in the design stage.

For example, the Natrium technology being developed by US TerraPower and GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy features a 345-megawatt liquid-sodium-cooled fast reactor with a separate molten-salt-based energy storage system. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.

Natrium is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by DOE. The company originally had hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied HALEU fuel to get a demonstration unit up and running by 2028. However, concerns about Russian HALEU deliveries have pushed the commissioning date to 2030.

The uranium ban legislation expires at the end of 2040. In the meantime, while one of its purposes is to undermine Russia's dominance of the international market for nuclear fuel and technology, Russian offiicials have been quick to point out that its most negative effects are likely to be on the global market.

Russia's state nuclear corporation Rosatom called the ban a discriminatory political move that would undermine the international market for enriched uranium but would not stop Russia from developing its global business.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a news briefing that“it's hard for the Americans to compete with us on the international market,” adding that the ban was“nothing more than unfair competition” and not critical for the Russian nuclear industry.“Our nuclear industry is one of the most advanced in the world,” Peskov said.“We will continue to develop this industry.”

Russia's ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said:

Rosatom is the world leader in terms of the number of nuclear reactor construction projects being undertaken simultaneously, with three units in Russia and 33 abroad.

Moreover, its foreign projects all involve ongoing technical support, training and 60-year-long fuel supplies. Since 2023 Rosatom also become the exclusive supplier to Brazil of products related to enriched uranium. This long-term partnership with Brasilia replaces previous imports from Canada and European consortia.

Rosatom's foreign projects include:



the four-unit Akkuyu NPP under construction in Turkiye Akkuyu;

the four-unit El Dabaa NPP under construction in Egypt;

four more units at Kudankulam NPP in India, with promises of further contracts;

four units in China; and two units in Bangladesh.",US Ban On Russian Uranium Could Backfire,"Earlier in May, the UK government awarded £196 million ($245 million) to Urenco to build a new uranium enrichment facility at its Capenhurst site in northwest England.

I am off on a mini-sabbatical for a few days. We all need a break once in a while, and I'm due for one. I shall return to these pages on Thursday, hopefully relaxed and refreshed. Well, refreshed, maybe. Since the news landscape will likely not change during my absence, I doubt relaxation will be an option.

Who's up for sushi?

There are a couple of good sushi places not far from me. I enjoy sushi. I am by no means a sushi connoisseur or fanatic, but it makes for a nice break from the dinner routine now and then. After all, man cannot live on cheeseburgers alone, although I came close to proving that he could during my bachelor days. For the record, I love Indian food, too.

Of course, the danger in going out for sushi or enjoying any food that is not a part of one's own ethnic group is that one runs the risk of being labeled a colonizer, an appropriator, or a racist. I didn't know we were still doing racism. I thought everyone was transphobic or Islamophobic. Oh well. It's all pretty much the same at this point, anyway. If you're guilty of one ""-ism,"" you're guilty of all of them.

But now and then, sanity prevails, and those who want to somehow benefit from or marinate in accusations of racism are yanked back into reality. For an example of that we go to England, of all places.

The Telegraph reports that an employment tribunal in London has ruled that a white provost at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London was not being racist when she told a Japanese professor that she and her family enjoy sushi. Keep in mind that this incident dates back to 2021. The tribunal found that Provost Claire Ozanne was only attempting small talk when she remarked to Professor Nana Sato-Rossberg that she and her family liked sushi and proceeded to recommend a restaurant. Sato-Rossberg, who is Japanese, likened the comment to someone telling a German that they liked sausage. She has also accused Ozanne of being ""unconsciously biased"" in the past. Whatever that is. I suppose that meant Sato-Rossberg was probably looking for an axe and a place to grind it.

Sato-Rossberg took her gripe to the school, which dismissed her complaint following an investigation. She then sought relief through an employment tribunal, which was similarly unmoved. Employment Judge Jillian Brown noted that in 18 months, the topic of sushi came up once, and that was only because Ozanne wanted to find a point of common interest with Sato-Rossberg and never said anything derogatory about Japan. Furthermore:

The tribunal concluded that, even if [Prof] Ozanne’s comments in this regard were partly because of [Prof Sato-Rossberg’s] race … they were not a detriment, nor harassment. The tribunal decided that [Prof] Ozanne mentioning a sushi restaurant and her family’s love of sushi was not a detriment because a reasonable person would not consider themselves at a disadvantage when a manager, trying to be friendly and find common ground, was enthusiastic about food from the person’s country of origin. A reasonable person would not take offence at such complimentary and friendly words. In this case, [Prof] Ozanne’s words were not even ‘unfortunate’. They were not reasonably seen as hurtful or misjudged. On the contrary, [Prof Sato-Rossberg’s] objection reflected [her] own hypersensitivity and predisposition to find fault with Ms Ozanne. (sic)

So there is your win for the week.

Wine recommendation

Because I have a plane to catch, and airport drinks are expensive.

For some reason, the local liquor store was suddenly flooded with one brand this week. I don't think the state has case lot sales on wine, but you never know. So I had to hunt a little bit to find something new. Meet the 2022 Doña Paula Estate Malbec.

This is another high-altitude Malbec from the Eco Valley in Argentina. It retails for around $13 and consistently scores high with most reviewers. This Malbec has a great balance in acidity and leans, but doesn't rush toward dryness and tannins. It has just enough of an edge to make it a good Malbec, but not enough to turn off someone who doesn't enjoy dry wines. It is heavy on the dark berries with a bit of oak, and a hint of pepper. This wine is a great choice, given the price point and the ratings.

That's it for me. Have a good weekend, and I'll see you next week.",Weekend Parting Shot: Sushi Isn't Racist. Who Knew?,"Since the news landscape will likely not change during my absence, I doubt relaxation will be an option.

The Vatican recently released a staunchly pro-life document, Dignitas Infinita (“Infinite Dignity”), that identifies various threats to human dignity such as abortion, euthanasia, and surrogacy.

Nonetheless, various nations continue moving in the opposite direction on core life issues. This week, “EWTN Pro-Life Weekly” surveyed the state of abortion policy and related family life issues across several continents.

Europe elevates support for abortion

In March, France became the first nation in the world to specifically enshrine abortion as part of the country’s constitution with an abortion amendment passing by a 780-72 vote conducted in the Palace of Versailles.

In April, the European Union (EU) Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution to add abortion and include abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution criticized the doctor’s rights of conscience and specifically called out Poland and Malta for their pro-life laws.

The EU is not the only international body that supports and pushes abortion on a global scale.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee called on the U.S. government to bring its laws in line with the World Health Organization’s 2022 Abortion Care Guidelines, calling the laws human rights violations. These guidelines call for abortion to be available on request with no limits on gestation, without any waiting periods, and without recommendations or parental consent.

The U.N. and World Health Organization, among other organizations, recently launched the Human Reproductive Program, part of which features videos promoting abortion and guiding health care workers around the world to walk clients through the abortion process.

Asia and the Middle East

Abortion is broadly legal in the two of the most populous countries in the world: China and India. Legalized in 1953, China has one of the highest rates of abortion in the world, at 49 abortions for every 1,000 reproductive-aged women, according to the Guttmacher Institute, supported by the nation’s family planning program.

But India has another issue impacting abortion: sex-selective abortion, or aborting a child because she is a girl. According to a 2022 Pew survey, 40% of Indians say sex-selective abortion is acceptable.

In the interview with EWTN News President and COO Montse Alvarado on “EWTN Pro-Life Weekly,” Rebecca Shah, co-director of the University of Dallas’ program for Indo-American Friendship and Understanding, explained the broad legality of the practice and the alarmingly accepted custom of sex-selective abortion.

In spite of India’s large population — 1.4 billion people — population decline is a “serious issue,” Shah noted.

“For the first time in India, the total fertility rate has dipped below replacement level of 2.1. We are now at 2,” she noted. “India’s population is slowly declining.”

India enacted the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in 1971 and has many criteria allowing women to obtain abortions.

Though many nations have increasingly permissive abortion laws, such as Japan, where abortion was decriminalized in 1948, some countries, such as Singapore, are starting to promote family. Singapore officially decriminalized abortion in 1974 and widely accepts abortion, but currently has a strong pro-family government.

EWTN News Vice President and Editorial Director Matthew Bunson recently interviewed Cardinal William Goh, the archbishop of Singapore, to talk about ongoing work in the country to encourage family life.

“We are trying to protect the family. We have 11 organizations that deal with family life, so we have to work hard at it,” Goh said. “I won’t say that we are doing extremely well, but because we belong to this Asian culture, that family dimension is always important.”

Goh noted that factors such as affluence, or both parents working, can impact family size, while younger people “are not interested” in having families as it affects their commitments, career, and social time.

While Singapore is below the replacement rate for population growth, the government is stepping in to promote family life.

“The beautiful part is this, the government is working with us all. We have a ministry, we call it a Ministry of Social and Family. This ministry, they try to promote family life,” Goh continued. “The programs that they have are very good programs, so we complement each other. We are grateful that the government also sees the importance of growing the family, strengthening our family, and healing people who are divorced and those from dysfunctioning families.”

In contrast, abortion remains fully illegal in Laos and the Philippines as well as in Iran. Numerous East Asian and Middle Eastern nations have strong limitations on abortion. In Afghanistan, Pakistan, Myanmar, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, and Bhutan, abortion is permitted in cases to save a woman’s life. Some of those countries have exceptions for rape, incest, or the physical and mental health of the mother.

Expansion of abortion in Latin America

Currently, 12 of Mexico’s 32 states allow abortion, while Argentina made headlines in 2020 after its Congress legalized abortion up to 12 weeks, making it the largest country in Latin America to allow the procedure.

In 2021, Mexico’s Supreme Court struck down a pro-life law in Coahuila that criminalized abortion. Just two years later, the high court threw out all federal criminal penalties by ruling that national laws prohibiting the procedure were unconstitutional. The ruling requires federal health institutions to offer abortions, but access to the procedure remains restricted through most of Mexico.

The Marea Verde, or Green Wave Movement, a grassroots coalition of pro-abortion protesters who wear green bandanas, have pushed for more access to abortion. Their bandanas have become a badge for pro-abortion movements across Latin America as well as in the United States.

However, pro-life Argentinians see a glimmer of hope in their new president, Javier Milei. Since taking the helm of Argentina in December 2023, the controversial leader has expressed a desire to roll back Argentina’s law and even called abortion “aggravated murder.”

Buenos Aires, 30 May 2024 (IICA) – The Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) will collaborate with technical agencies of the Argentine government in the prevention and control of the corn leafhopper disease, which during the 2023/24 season has spread across corn plantations in the northern and central regions of the country, causing severe economic losses and posing a threat to food security.

Private estimates indicate that the pest has destroyed 20% of the projected corn production for this year in Argentina.

The cooperation initiative for the 2024/25 agricultural season was outlined in a meeting attended by the National Director of Agriculture, Nicolas Bronzovich; the President of the National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA), Pablo Cortese; the IICA Representative in Argentina, Fernando Camargo; and IICA technical experts Carolina Pivetta and Tomás Krotsch.

The population of the insect known as the corn leafhopper (Dalbulus maidis), a vector of the disease known as corn stunt, has experienced an unprecedented growth in Argentina this year. This prompted the Secretariat of Bioeconomy to create a special working group composed of public and private actors, with the mission of mitigating the spread of this pest and providing tools to farmers to prepare for the upcoming corn season.

Mitigating the Impact



The goal of the initiative is to reduce the economic losses associated with decreased production while preserving grain quality, and ensuring environmental sustainability through integrated management practices that optimize the use of approved phytosanitary products for pest prevention and control.

Given its expertise in agricultural health issues in the hemisphere and its capacity to provide technical cooperation, IICA will work with Argentine agencies on issues related to the governance of information networks that contribute to making early warning and disease prevention systems more efficient.

The fundamental objective of this effort is to provide timely information and technical tools to farmers so they can make decisions that mitigate the impact on corn cultivation.

About IICA

IICA is the specialized agency for agriculture in the Inter-American system, with a mission to encourage, promote and support its 34 Member States in their efforts to achieve agricultural development and rural well-being through international technical cooperation of excellence.

Participants in the XVII extraordinary meeting of CAS explained that the European Union (EU) Regulation 1115/2023 against deforestation, which is set to come into effect next January, is not based on science, and that there is great uncertainty about its application, which could be detrimental. They also stated that the countries of the South have developed sustainable production schemes.

The General Assembly of the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) is being held in Paris this week, which is why the CAS meeting took place in the French capital as well. The WOAH, which is celebrating its centenary this year, is the institution that coordinates global action against animal diseases that pose a threat to food security and economic growth, making it of major importance for the productive systems of the Southern Cone.

Attending the CAS meeting were Fernando Vilella, Secretary of Bioeconomy of Argentina and pro tempore president of CAS; Fernando Mattos, Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries of Uruguay; Esteban Valenzuela, Minister of Agriculture of Chile; Carlos Goulart, Secretary of Agricultural Defense of Brazil; José Carlos Martin, President of the National Animal Health and Quality Service (SENACSA) of Paraguay; and Manuel Otero, Director General of IICA.

Also present were Gastón Funes, Agricultural Attaché of Argentina to the European Union (EU); Carlos Cherniak, Permanent Representative of Argentina to FAO; Daniela Acuña, Deputy Director of the Office of Agricultural Studies and Policies (ODEPA) of Chile; Santiago Derqui, Chief of Staff of the Secretariat of Bioeconomy of Argentina; Martín Rapetti, Vice President of the Federation of Rural Associations of Mercosur (FARM); and Gabriel Delgado, Technical Secretary of CAS and IICA Representative in Brazil.

For more than 20 years, the CAS, whose technical secretariat is managed by the IICA, has played a strategic role as a forum for consultation and coordination of regional actions, comprising the Ministers of Agriculture of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

“International trade restrictions imposed on those who sell agricultural products and cannot certify non-deforestation are not based on science. But one must choose between being right or wanting to sell, and for this reason, we have already advanced in exporting certified deforestation-free beef and soy to Europe,” said Vilella.

For his part, Minister Mattos indicated that “politically, we reject this regulation, which constitutes an additional environment-based trade restriction. However, the requirement exists, and we must be prepared, although this does not mean we should not take all possible actions to postpone the implementation of Regulation 1115.”

“We cannot accept that the Europeans are the champions of environmental protection, when it is in our region where natural resources are protected,” added Mattos.

José Carlos Martin, head of the public institution that controls animal health in Paraguay, questioned how quickly the regulation must be implemented and the lack of clarity regarding the requirements to comply with it. He referred to the need for the countries in the region to undertake a collective strategy of dialogue and negotiation.

The Minister of Agriculture of Chile, Esteban Valenzuela, stressed the importance of CAS’s work as a key forum for the exchange of information and coordinated and concerted action in the face of common challenges in areas such as health or climate resilience. He said that common denominators can also be scaled up to the continental level. Additionally, he recalled the commitment made at the 1st Ministerial Conference on Low-Emission Food Systems, held last year in Chile, where 24 countries from five continents committed to working to position agriculture as a relevant sector to offer innovative solutions to the climate crisis.

Residues and pesticides

The ministers also discussed the European policy on maximum residue limits and pesticide reduction. They emphasized that, although it is presented as an environmental issue, it is actually a matter of food safety.

In this regard, it was agreed to work together and undertake coordinated action in the various forums where this issue is being discussed.

Carlos Goulart, the representative of Brazil, focused on the importance of the region jointly rejecting the imposition of single production models, which do not recognize the singularities, good practices, and production traditions of each area.

The meeting also included a presentation on the initial progress of the coordinated actions of CAS countries, in collaboration with the private sector, to strengthen research on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sequestration attributable to agriculture in the region. This is the implementation of a decision made at the previous CAS session, which took place in March in Argentina, and whose goal is to visibilize the sector's contribution to climate change mitigation.

The CAS session in Paris also revealed regional cooperation projects being carried out to combat the New World screwworm fly and the fruit fly, pests that transcend national borders and threaten the income of agricultural producers as well as food security.

The trio – two males and one female— were born on Jan. 3 and represent a rare occurrence.

“Normally, Andean bears have one or two cubs at a time,” said Mike Allen, director of the Queens Zoo. “We had three which is very rare so that's especially exciting.”

Climate change and population growth are reducing the bears’ natural habitat in the Andean Mountains of Colombia and Bolivia. The Queens Zoo breeds them as part of a special program organized by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums designed to diversify their gene pool.

When the bears reach adulthood, they will be given to other zoos in the U.S. There are currently 33 Andean bears in North America, the zoo said.

They were born to Nicole and Bouba when the pair mated sometime in the summer, according to the zoo. Bouba has since passed from an illness.

The new triplets haven’t yet been named. Allen said the zoo is open to licensing the naming rights to bears.

“It's certainly possible. We're always looking for ways to support the organization,” he said.

Andean bears are also known as spectacle bears because of the whitish markings around their eyes and muzzle unique to each bear. Males can reach 6 feet in height and weigh up to 340 pounds, accounting to Allen.

The cubs are still working out how to use all that mass, according to Allen, and still wobbling around their enclosure.

“The first day we let them out, one of them climbed all the way to the top point and started calling,” Allen said. “Mom had to come over and climb up the tree and help them.”",‘Very rare’: Queens has 3 new bears (at the zoo),"Three Andean bears have left their birthing den and are ready to meet the people of Queens.

The resolution demands justice and accountability for those responsible for the attack as it left 86 dead and more than 200 people injured. In April, Argentina’s highest criminal court blamed Iran and Hezbollah for the attack.

“It has been three decades since the lethal AMIA Jewish Center Bombing took place in Buenos Aires, and we continue to tirelessly demand justice and accountability for the vile perpetrators responsible for the attack, including Iran’s current Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi and other terrorist proxies,” said Rep. Diaz-Balart. We solemnly remember and mourn the victims of this horrific act; they will never be forgotten. Since the terrorist attack against innocent Israelis on October 7, we have witnessed a dramatic rise in antisemitism, hatred, and vitriol against the Jewish community, as well as the attempts to delegitimize Israel both across our country – from campuses to businesses, and even here within the House.”

Rep. Diaz-Balart concluded, “We know the consequences of ignoring the insidious threat of bigotry and antisemitism and must not let history repeat itself. I remain unwavering in my commitment to combatting antisemitism and will continue working with my colleagues to hold accountable those who engage in hateful acts.”

Furthermore, Rep. Wasserman Schultz added that as levels of anti-Semitism continue to climb worldwide, crimes such as these cannot go unanswered.

“It has been three decades since the tragic AMIA Jewish Center bombing, yet there is still no justice for the 85 victims, the hundreds of injured, and countless people who were traumatized,” said Rep. Wasserman Schultz. “With antisemitism on the rise around the world, this attack on Argentina’s thriving Jewish community must not go unanswered. Congressmen Diaz-Balart, Espaillat, Gonzales, and I are proud to honor the victims of this attack and champion justice for their loved ones.”

Finally, the resolution demands INTERPOL member countries “comply with arrest orders for individuals responsible” relating to the attack, among other calls to action.","Diaz-Balart, Wasserman Schultz Sponsor Resolution for 30th Anniversary of Jewish Community Center Bombing","Florida Representatives in the U.S. House, Mario Diaz-Balart (R) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D) – both Co-Chairs of the Latino-Jewish Caucus – have sponsored a resolution recognizing the 30th anniversary of the 1994 AMIA Jewish Community Center bombing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

From Germany to Argentina and then north to Alaska.

Two German college students, Antonia Staacke and Laura Moller, have shown remarkable resilience on their journey from Germany to Argentina and then north to Alaska. They embarked on their bicycle trek in Patagonia, traveling through South America and Central America, and now they are biking through North America. This journey that has spanned almost eight months since October 2023.

Antonia Staacke, 27, and Laura Moller, 28, have demonstrated their commitment to a cause close to their hearts. Taking a year off before their final year at their university, they are not only exploring their own potential but also raising funds for World Bicycle Relief.

Their commitment to World Bicycle Relief has not only led them on this fundraising trip but also inspired many along the way. World Bicycle Relief is a nonprofit that distributes bicycles to developing countries. Their journey is not just about testing their limits and physical strength, but also about raising awareness about the importance of bicycles in developing countries. They admit, ""We have come quite far.""

Their Instagram account is longest.ride22, and they have had 109 bicycles donated on their behalf during their journey. Both their website, longest-ride.org, and Instagram account track their progress and experiences.

The two are getting real life experiences in their university studies of geography. Antonia plans to teach English and geography in the secondary level, while Laura intends to use her geography degree in a sustainability or a renewal industry, like a wind farm company. Laura was shocked and impressed with all the wind turbines along Highway 71.

""The windmills, I have not seen so many in my whole life,"" she said, laughing. ""It makes sense because it is very windy.""

Averaging 60 miles a day from South and Central America, Antonia and Laura came through Mexico, then hit the United States going through Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and the southwest corner of Nebraska. On Tuesday night, they stayed with the mayor of Brush, Colorado, in her home and then headed up on Highway 71 to Kimball.

Stopping at the Kimball Public Library for a Wi-Fi connection, Laura had an interview for an apartment back in Germany for her final year at the university.

In Kimball, some locals chipped in to pay for a motel room for them to rest and get revived for the next segment of their trip. A motel room with a shower was a dream come true for the two cyclists.

Their experiences have been so varied, but they acknowledged some scary experiences that almost always revolved around traffic, with Argentina and Guatemala being the worst experiences. Most roads in South America have no shoulder, and many drivers do not pay attention.

They have their return trip to Germany booked for Aug. 3 leaving, from Anchorage. Antonia said, ""We have only two months left, which is not much, but manageable."" From Kimball, they will go through Wyoming, Montana and then to Canada and then west to Anchorage, Alaska.

In Patagonia, they camped out mostly because it was very remote, sometime 200 miles between towns. Now they try to camp in people's backyards, but motels are a special treat.

Antonia refers to their bikes ""as their home on wheels."" They knew they would have lots of flat tires and punctures, but they also have experienced ripped gears and shifting cables. Soon they will change the chains because chains stretch. With all of their bicycle repair experience, they probably could get a job at a bike shop if they wanted to do that.

Laura said they have learned that ""after every challenge, usually something good happens. There are lots of challenging moments, actually almost everyday. Good things happen usually because of the people we meet. All the people in every country have been really, really nice and supportive.""

They feel estranged from the country’s leadership — its wealthy prime minister and their members of parliament.

“It feels like you are second-class people. Our MPs don’t represent us people. Political leaders don’t understand what we go through,” said Barrie Stradling, 65. “Do they listen to people? I don’t think they do.”

In a coffee shop in Jakarta, Ni Wayan Suryatini, 46, bemoaned the results of the recent election, in which the son of Indonesia’s former president ascended to the country’s vice presidency and the opposition parties seemed to do little to stop him.

“It is difficult to trust them since they only want to reach their goals. As long as they achieve their goals, they will forget everything else,” Suryatini said of politicians.

And inside her cheerfully cluttered craft shop in Greeley, Colorado, Sally Otto, 58, contemplated with dread the upcoming U.S. presidential election between President Joe Biden and the man he defeated in 2020, former President Donald Trump: “I feel like we’re back where we were, with the same two poor choices,” Otto said.

As half the world’s population votes in elections this year, voters are in a foul mood. From South Korea to Argentina, incumbents have been ousted in election after election. In Latin America alone, leaders and their parties had lost 20 elections in a row until this past weekend’s presidential election in Mexico, according to a tally by Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor of government.

The dynamic is likely to repeat itself as the European Union launches its legislative elections this week, where conservative populist parties are expected to register gains. EU parliamentary elections are usually an opportunity for voters in individual countries to vent their frustrations because the candidates they elect will have power in Brussels rather than their own national capitals.

“In many ways we’ve never had it so good, objectively speaking, and yet people are so unsatisfied,” said Matthias Matthijs, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C.

The reasons for the dissatisfaction are many, from social media’s ability to magnify problems to the painful recovery from the coronavirus pandemic to the backlash toward economic and cultural changes sparked by globalization.

Though in places like Europe the populist right has notched several gains, there is little ideological consistency globally to the unhappiness. In a recent Pew poll across 24 democracies, a median of 74% of respondents said they didn’t think politicians cared what people like them think, and 42% said no political party represented their viewpoint.

“It’s about economics and culture, but it’s also about the functioning of politics itself,” said Richard Wike, managing director of Pew’s Global Attitudes Research. “It can lead to a situation where politics is seen as a zero-sum game. People see more of an existential threat from the other side, and that makes people unhappy about democracy.”

Experts say there is one notable exception to the trend of global anger with elected leaders — places where the leaders are anti-establishment, populist strongmen.

“Antisystem outsider, populist figures are winning more than in the past,” Levitsky said. “Whether they constitute any movement is unclear to me.”

In Mexico, leftist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is termed out but broke the streak of losses for Latin American leaders’ parties as his hand-picked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, won Sunday’s presidential election. In Argentina, newly elected president Javier Milei, a self-described “anarcho-capitalist” dubbed “the madman” by admirers, remains popular despite the country’s crippling economic problems that have persisted following his austerity and deregulation reforms.

“I was never interested in politics because nothing ever changed,” said Sebastian Sproviero, a 37-year-old engineer at a Buenos Aires concert that featured Milei belting out rock anthems. “Now it has.”

In India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticized for eroding the world’s most populous democracy, the Pew poll found the country had the highest support among all surveyed countries for a more authoritarian form of government, with two-thirds of respondents there backing a strong leader system.

Still, even some of the more authoritarian governments such as Modi’s have had to deal with dissatisfaction with the status quo. Modi appears to have won his third term as India’s prime minister in national elections that wrapped up Tuesday, but his conservative Hindu nationalist party had an underwhelming showing and will likely need to join a coalition to form a government.

The global anti-incumbent mood, coupled with the success of anti-establishment populists, comes amid warning signs for democracy. Pew found democracy’s appeal slipping even as it remained the preferred system of government around the world. Freedom House, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that promotes democracy, said its “Freedom Index” measuring democratic health globally has declined for 18 straight years.

Adrian Shahbaz, a vice president at Freedom House, attributed the erosion of support to a series of crises since the turn of the century, including the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the U.S., the 2008-09 global recession and the coronavirus pandemic. Adding to the stress, he said, is the increasing focus on identity issues such as transgender policies and immigration in democratic politics, especially in Europe and the U.S.

“The key cleavages in democracies tend to be around identity issues rather than economic ones,” Shahbaz said. “That in itself can be very risky because democracy depends on a civil identity that goes beyond tribal identifications.”

This year the curator of the Biennale’s 60th edition, Adriano Pedrosa, has chosen to focus on queer, Indigenous and self-taught artists, particularly those from the Global South. Many are being shown at the Biennale for the first time; some were known in their lifetime but, for various reasons, disappeared from public view. But does this recognition in Venice translate into inclusion at an art fair, and does it have an impact on prices?

Quite a few Indigenous artists’ work are on show, and for sale, at Art Basel this year. And even if it is their first outing in Venice, do not forget that some of these artists are already well established in their own countries—they just lacked the international exposure.

Nevertheless, “the Biennale effect is real, both for visibility and values,” says Thiago Gomide, a partner at the Brazilian gallery Gomide & Co. “People pay more attention when an artist is shown in Venice, and this creates more demand,” he says. Gomide’s São Paulo gallery is showing several Indigenous artists who were seen in the Arsenale in Venice at Art Basel. One is the Paraguayan Guaraní artist Julia Isídrez, who makes ceramic pieces based on the animals of her area. “She lives in a remote region of Paraguay. It took me four months even to get in touch with her, she has no phone,” Gomide says. “She was unrepresented until a year ago, but there is now a waiting list for her works.” Isidrez’s prices range from $15,000 to $20,000, and Gomide says they are now ten times higher than 18 months ago. “The exposure is making a significant change in her life, it is a huge deal for her,” Gomide adds.

Rising demand

In Art Basel’s Unlimited section, the Labor gallery from Mexico City is bringing a performative installation titled Ko ta mapungey ka (Water is Also Territory), (2020) by the Chilean Mapuche and non-binary artist Seba Calfuqueo. The Labor founder Pamela Echeverría, who began representing Calfuqueo 18 months ago, agrees that the Biennale—where Calfuqueo is showing in the Arsenale—has had a major boosting effect, notably for institutional interest. “Prices were ridiculously low, but now there is a lot more demand,” Echeverría says. Today this means paying $9,000 for small sculptures offered at the fair and $70,000 for the performance piece.

Also in Unlimited is Marcados, a series of 37 images by the Swiss-born photographer Claudia Andujar (made in 1981-83, printed 2008-15). Andujar has devoted her life to defending Brazil’s Yanomami people, and the photographs, taken during a vaccination campaign, show individuals wearing numbered labels—something that reminded Andujar of genocide in Europe. This is one of just two complete sets (the other is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York) and is for sale at $2.5m. It is presented jointly by the São Paulo gallery Vermelho and Gomide & Co, and, if it sells, 5% of the price will be donated to the NGO Hutukara Associação Yanomami (Hay), which supports Yanomami people.

There are several other Indigenous artists at Art Basel who were selected by Pedrosa for the main exhibition in Venice, notably La Chola Poblete of Argentina, represented by Barro of New York, and the Angolan Sandra Poulson, represented by Jahmek Contemporary Art in Luanda.

The fair also features Indigenous artists who were not in Venice. For example, in the Features section, the Brazilian gallery Almeida & Dale is showing 25 paintings by Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966) mainly from the 1950s and 1960s. Dos Prazeres chose to explore the world of the post-slavery Black population and its fight for freedom and equality, at a time when most of the country was still focused on European culture. This did not go down well with the Brazilian authorities: his work was censored by the country’s military dictatorship in 1964.

Falling out of fashion

Prices for Dos Prazeres’s colourful, lively works range from $100,000 to $300,000. “Heitor had a measure of success in his lifetime, but then he fell out of fashion and visibility,” says the gallery director Paul Jenkins. “This was partly because of the concrete art movement, with its emphasis on abstraction, and also because he was a Black artist showing Black people.”

Another Indigenous artist, the Bolivian Alejandro Mario Yllanes, came to a mysterious end, probably assassinated by the political powers of the time. The largely self-taught painter and printmaker, born in 1913, had documented the culture and exploitation of the Aymara people, and in 1946 an exhibition in Mexico City’s Palacio de Bellas Artes featured 16 large-scale paintings and 20 woodblock prints by him.

The preface to that show was written by Diego Rivera, showing the international acclaim Yllanes enjoyed at the time. He was granted a fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, but never collected the funds, and never exhibited again; he disappeared, and is thought to have died around 1960.

Yllanes’s work was rediscovered by the London gallery Ben Elwes Fine Art, which last year began exhibiting the 50 or so works Yllanes left behind. At Art Basel, in collaboration with Gomide & Co, the gallery is showing Viva la Guerra (1938), priced at $750,000, and the accompanying wood engraving Trincheras (1944), at $25,000.

This year the US pavilion at Venice featured Jeffrey Gibson, a Mississippi Choctaw/Cherokee painter and sculptor, and the first Indigenous artist to have a solo show there. It was an ostensibly feel-good exhibition with colourful, geometric patterns and beadwork on flags, sculpture, painting and a lively video of native American dancers. But some of the texts told a darker story, of exploitation and devaluation of native cultures.

Gibson has three galleries: Sikkema Jenkins & Co in New York, Stephen Friedman in London, and Roberts Projects in Los Angeles. At Art Basel, Sikkema is showing an acrylic painting on elk hide, Someone to watch over me (2023).

Gibson already has a secondary market and, for instance at Phillips last month, a beaded sign, Make me feel it (2015), doubled its estimate at $101,600. However, the “Venice effect” is not automatic, and a beaded figure by Gibson from 2014, Always After Now, just failed to sell at Sotheby’s in May, falling short of its $150,000-$200,000 estimate.

The reach of Álvarez’s beverages, along with other coca-infused products, remains limited to artisanal fairs in Bolivia and Peru, countries where the leaf is legal – so long as it’s not used to make cocaine. As for the rest of the world, a United Nations convention classifies coca leaf as a narcotic and imposes a blanket prohibition on drugs.

Bolivia’s Government is reviving its decades-long push not only to destigmatise the plant and make it legal to export but also to create a global market for coca liquor, soap, shampoo, toothpaste, baking flour and more. Its efforts received a major boost last northern autumn when the Who announced it would launch a scientific review of the coca leaf, the first step in a lengthy process to decriminalise the leaf worldwide.

“The procedures have been initiated for the first time in history,” Juan Carlos Alurralde, general secretary of Bolivia’s vice presidency said. “The leaf will be seriously investigated.”

The last time that Who undertook a study of the coca leaf was in 1992, but detailed findings were never made public.

Officials from Colombia and Bolivia unveiled the research proposal alongside Who representatives in Vienna earlier this year. They have until October, when a committee meeting on the study will kick off in Geneva, to submit research about coca’s medicinal and nutritional properties.

The study will also consider Bolivia’s efforts to commercialise coca, determining the maximum amount of the cocaine alkaloid coca products could contain on the world market.

“Experts have to evaluate whether it results in dependency,” Alurralde said.

Nearly 80 kilometres north of La Paz, where the high-altitude bush paints the hills of Trinidad Pampa green, coca growers, known as “cocaleros,” welcomed news of the Who review. For them, chewing coca leaves is a daily habit likened to drinking coffee.

“It helps me to harvest without fatigue and support my family,” said farmer Juan de Dios Cocarico, stuffing a wad of coca into his mouth as he ripped leaves off the stalk.

Global decriminalisation, cocaleros say, would bring more export revenues as an economic crisis looms due to the rapid depletion of Bolivia’s foreign exchange reserves.

“This is a coca-growing town that lives off coca,” said Frido Duran, a leader of coca growers in Yungas, a region northeast of La Paz. “We are convinced that this (Who) study will vindicate all that our grandparents taught us.”

Across Bolivia, the leaf sustains 70,000 cocaleros and generates some US$279 million each year as the farmers sell the foliage in bulk to be chewed as a mild stimulant, incorporated into religious ceremonies or transformed into goods marketed as a modern-day miracle cure that relieves altitude sickness, boosts stamina and dulls hunger.

For Bolivia, cocaleros are largely subsistence farmers who say they have few viable crop options.

For the United States and other Western countries that long have blocked Bolivia’s attempts to decriminalise the leaf, cocaleros are maligned as the cause of many of the world’s drug problems.

“With each iteration of US policy the coca cultivators of Bolivia were forced into whatever policy guideline was good for US bureaucracy,” said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivia-based research group. “During the war on drugs, coca farmers were drug traffickers, then narco-terrorists.”

Bolivia’s focus on removing the leaf from the UN blacklist stems from its skepticism about coca-eradication schemes, which authorities say have brought little more than violence since then-US President Richard Nixon launched his “war on drugs” in 1971.

Unable to force cocaleros to sacrifice their meagre livelihoods by planting substitute crops, Bolivian authorities started licensing farmers to grow coca instead.

In requesting the study of the coca plant at the UN, Bolivia’s President Luis Arce urged nations to seize “a new opportunity to correct this grave historical error.”

Washington said it was open to the Who study, but signalled it wasn’t supporting legalisation.

A legal coca leaf market, said the US Office of National Drug Control Policy, doesn’t keep illegal ones from sprouting up. In a statement, the agency cited US Government figures showing as coca cultivation in Bolivia doubled from 2006 to 2021, illicit cocaine production also surged by 175 per cent.

As of 2022, the UN said Bolivia had 29,900 hectares of coca crop, of which only 22,000 were legal.

The country’s former President Evo Morales, a long-time leader of coca growers’ unions who famously threw the US Drug Enforcement Agency out of Bolivia in 2009, used his office to develop Bolivia’s state-regulated coca market and lobby the UN to lift its ban.

The leftist icon clinched a diplomatic victory in 2013 when the UN agreed to let Bolivia rejoin its global narcotic drug treaty with a carve-out for traditional uses of coca leaves.

But Morales’ push for a Who study ended when violent protests rocked Bolivia in 2019, leading to his resignation and exile after 14 years in power.","Bolivia releases coca-based beer, but international markets uncertain","As for the rest of the world, a United Nations convention classifies coca leaf as a narcotic and imposes a blanket prohibition on drugs.

Imports are expected to grow as the Argentine peso appreciates against the US dollar

Argentina recorded a historic foreign trade exchange surplus of US$ 2.656 billion in May, Argentina's Trade Exchange (ICA) reported Thursday in Buenos Aires. The new figures surpassed the previous record of US$ 2.543 billion from May 2009. So far in 2024, Argentina has accumulated a balance of + US$ 8.8 billion.

After the devaluation of the peso in December, President Javier Milei's administration has kept a positive balance on the trade front since taking office, in addition to a surplus in public expenditures.

Last month, exports totaled US$ 7.622 billion (+21.7 % year-on-year), while the devaluation resulted in imports plummeting by 32.8% to US$ 4.966 billion.

Despite a rebound in imports, a positive outcome is still projected for 2024. According to the latest Relevamiento de Expectativas de Mercado (REM) of the Argentine Central Bank, exports are expected to end the year at around US$ 77.904 billion, while imports are expected to reach US$ 61.517 billion, for a surplus of around US$ 16.400 billion, driven among other items by agricultural exports now that last year's severe drought has been overcome.

After a May 2023 deficit of US$1,124 million as a result of the drought, exports grew by 21.7% year-on-year until the end of the year while imports fell by 32.8% interannually.

In this scenario, Economy Minister Luis Toto Caputo told agro-exporters that the blend dollar would remain until December, allowing a liquidation of 20% of these revenues in the financial market.

Analysts have warned about the need to monitor the cash base flows of export liquidation, given the fall experienced since May, even with the improvement observed for agricultural flows as the growing trend of exports in quantities will continue, mainly driven by the primary and energy sectors.

Regarding imports, the experts foresee that they will remain low although recovering in line with a peso appreciating against the US dollar.",Argentina records historic foreign trade surplus,"Argentina records historic foreign trade surplus21st Friday, June 2024 - 23:04 UTC Full articleImports are expected to grow as the Argentine peso appreciates against the US dollarArgentina recorded a historic foreign trade exchange surplus of US$ 2.656 billion in May, Argentina's Trade Exchange (ICA) reported Thursday in Buenos Aires.

According to the website AviaciónOnline , since October 2023, Bolivia’s state airline has operated a weekly flight between the South American country and the Island, using Boeing 737-800 aircraft.

According to the same source, BoA entered the Caribbean in October 2023 as part of an expansion that included flights to Caracas, Venezuela, and Asunción, Paraguay. Both of these destinations, as well as those to Buenos Aires, Lima, Madrid, Miami, and São Paulo, remain unchanged.

The reason for the cancellation of the weekly flight to Havana has not been disclosed at this time.

Nevertheless, the Island continues to lose connectivity with the rest of the continent. In March of this year, Aerolíneas Argentinas canceled its weekly route to Havana, a decision driven by the lack of profitability of this connection.

According to sources close to the company cited by the Argentine media outlet Infobae, in 2023 this route resulted in losses of half a million dollars. Additionally, it was noted that the decision was made after a “commercial analysis aimed at protecting and enhancing the company, as well as strengthening and prioritizing the destinations that are more economically beneficial.”

After an eight-year suspension, Aerolíneas Argentinas had resumed the Buenos Aires-Havana route with three weekly flights starting in July 2022.

According to press reports from that time, the route, which had existed in the past, was suspended in 2016. Starting in July 2022, it was covered with B737-MAX aircraft, making a stop in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, both on the outbound and return flights. At that time, the president of Aerolíneas Argentinas, Pablo Ceriani, told the press: “We have previous experience operating there. It is a highly requested flight by tour operators and travel agencies due to latent demand, and we believe it will complement the Punta Cana flight very well. Additionally, it is always great news to recover destinations that were abandoned.”

What appears to have triggered this?

Wednesday’s uprising appeared to be led by general commander of the army Juan José Zúñiga, who told journalists gathered at the plaza outside the palace that “Surely soon there will be a new Cabinet of ministers; our country, our state cannot go on like this.” But he added that he recognizes Arce as commander in chief “for now.” Zúñiga did not explicitly say whether he was the uprising’s leader, but in the palace, with bangs echoing behind him, he said the army was trying to “restore democracy and free our political prisoners.” [...]

“It’s a dynamic situation and there is a long history of military coups in Bolivia, but a lot of domestic and global power brokers are lining up behind Arce,” said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas.

According to a report from The Mirror, Chelsea have submitted their opening bid for the services of Aaron Anselmino as they look to build for the future. The Blues are keen on adding the Argentine defensive sensation to their squad amidst interest in his services from Manchester United.

Anselmino has had an impressive rise at Boca Juniors. While he was promoted to their first team just six months back, multiple top clubs have been following his progress from his days in their academy. The 19-year-old centre-back has featured in 10 matches for their Argentine club’s senior team and he even has a goal to his name.

He is considered to be one of the best young talents in all of South America and Chelsea are pushing hard to ensure he makes the move to Stamford Bridge. The Blues have already signed some top-quality young players in the past few windows as they look to build a team for the future and they feel Anselmino could play a big part in the long run.

Chelsea’s initial offer not good enough?

The London club have been closely monitoring the teenager for several months. They entered negotiations with Boca Juniors earlier this week and have finally submitted their initial offer, which is believed to be just over £14 million. The Blues are unlikely to succeed with their opening bid as the report suggests that the Argentine club are reluctant to accept the offer.

They are not willing to negotiate anything lower than his £20 million release clause and are also keen on ensuring they have a sell-on clause to entitle them to future profit. Chelsea want to send Anselmino on loan to sister club Strasbourg in France after signing him while Boca want to keep hold of the 19-year-old until the end of the year.

Manchester United also keen on Anselmino

While the Blues are working hard to sign him, Manchester United have also shown interest in the defensive sensation. They have scouted him on multiple occasions in recent months.

Raphael Varane has already left United and on top of that, the future of Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelöf is also uncertain. As a result, the Red Devils want to reinforce their backline. While the priority is to bring in a world-class centre-back, they are also considering signing Anselmino at the same time to add depth to their backline.","Chelsea, Manchester United told to pay £20 million to sign Aaron Anselmino","Chelsea have submitted an offer to sign Argentine defensive sensation Aaron Anselmino amidst interest from Manchester United.

Morales was initially among the country’s most powerful voices to say that approximately 200 members of the military who marched on Bolivia’s government palace alongside armored vehicles on Wednesday had attempted a “coup d’état.”

“We are convinced that democracy is the only way to resolve any difference and that institutions and the rule of law must be respected,” Morales wrote in a post on the social media platform X on the day of the military action.

“We reiterate the call for all those involved in this riot to be arrested and tried.” But on Sunday, Morales joined others who believe Arce himself orchestrated a “self coup” to win the sympathy of Bolivians at a time when his popularity is extremely low.

Arce “disrespected the truth, deceived us, lied, not only to the Bolivian people but to the whole world,” Morales said in a local broadcast program on Sunday. Morales is throwing his support behind an accusation made by former Gen. Juan José Zuñiga, who allegedly led the coup attempt.

Morales said Zuñiga informed colleagues and family of his plan before carrying it out, and that while in custody he told authorities that Arce had “betrayed” him. “The president told me: ‘The situation is very screwed up, very critical. It is necessary to prepare something to raise my popularity’,” Zúñiga quoted the Bolivian leader as saying.

That theory was quickly adopted by Arce’s political enemies, who dubbed it a “self-coup.”

“At some point the truth will be known,” a handcuffed Gen. Juan José Zúñiga told reporters while being transferred to prison Saturday. Morales called for an independent investigation into the Wednesday military action in a post on X on Sunday.

Shortly after the comments, Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo responded in an interview with state television with a slight aimed at Morales, saying “according to Evo, if there aren’t deaths, there is no coup d’état.”

Morales still wields a great deal of power in Bolivia, especially among coca growers and unions, while Arce has faced simmering discontent as the country reels from an economic crisis.

Morales, once Arce’s friend, resigned as president in 2019 amid unrest after he ran for an unconstitutional third term and fled into exile, an incident he insists was a coup. He threw his support behind Arce in the country’s 2020 election as candidate for his Movement for Socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS.

But their relationship soured when the leader returned from exile and Morales later announced he planned to run against Arce to be MAS’s candidate in the upcoming 2025 elections. Their fights have grown increasingly bitter as Morales has blocked much of Arce’s legislative agenda in Congress.

“We’ve been politically attacked,” Arce told The Associated Press in an interview Friday. But “we haven’t attacked” back. The feud has angered many Bolivians and Morales’ Sunday comments were not likely to help.

Morales said in the local radio program “Kausachun Coca” that he felt the incident damaged the image of Bolivia and its military. He also apologized for expressing solidarity with Arce.","Bolivian president orchestrated a ‘self-coup,’ political rival Evo Morales claims","Former Bolivian President Evo Morales on Sunday accused his political ally-turned-rival President Luis Arce of deceiving the Bolivian people by staging a “self-coup” last week to earn political points among the electorate, marking a sharp downturn in an already fraught relationship.

""I order all that are mobilized to return to their units,"" said the newly appointed army chief José Wilson Sánchez. ""No one wants the images we’re seeing in the streets.""

Soon after, troops began pulling back from the presidential palace.

Arce confronted Army Gen. Juan José Zúñiga, who was recently stripped of his military command and who appeared to be leading the rebellion, in the palace hallway, as shown in a video on Bolivian television. Zúñiga was later arrested after the attorney general opened an investigation against him. It wasn’t immediately clear what the charges were against him.

Zuniga said Arce asked him to storm the palace in a political move.

""The president told me: ‘The situation is very screwed up, very critical. It is necessary to prepare something to raise my popularity’,"" Zúñiga told reporters.

Zúñiga sajd he asked Arce if he should ""take out the armored vehicles?"" and Arce replied, ""Take them out.""

""I am your captain, and I order you to withdraw your soldiers, and I will not allow this insubordination,"" he said.

On X, Arce called for ""democracy to be respected.""

The United States said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged calm and restraint.

BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT WITHDRAWS AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL, LEAVING DIPLOMATIC POST VACANT

Bolivia, a country of 12 million people, has seen intensifying protests in recent months over the economy’s precipitous decline from one of the continent’s fastest-growing two decades ago to one of its most crisis-stricken.

The country also has seen a high-profile rift at the highest levels of the governing party. Arce and his one-time ally, leftist icon and former President Morales, have been battling for the future of Bolivia’s splintering Movement for Socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of elections in 2025.

The leadership of Bolivia’s largest labor union condemned the action and declared an indefinite strike of social and labor organizations in La Paz in defense of the government.

The incident was met with a wave of outrage by other regional leaders, including the Organization of American States; Gabriel Boric, the president of neighboring Chile; the leader of Honduras, and former Bolivian leaders.

The most recent attempted coup on the continent occurred in December 2022 when Peruvian President Pedro Castillo was arrested the same day that he attempted to dissolve Congress, declare a state of emergency and re-write the constitution. He was eventually impeached and removed from office.

Zuniga briefly entered the palace, according to local media.

Pemex's lean Zama spending undercuts goals

Mexico City, 21 November (Argus) — State-owned oil company Pemex's limited budget for developing one of Mexico's most-promising new oil fields is putting Mexico's crude production and refining goals at risk through 2030. First production from the Zama field will likely not start until at least 2028 instead of late next year, as forecast earlier, based on a timeline in a recent presentation from Pemex. Pemex continues to work on the basic engineering for the Zama field because of the lack of cash, staff of hydrocarbon regulator CNH said last week. The latest delay on Zama echoes criticism from when Pemex took over operating the field in 2022 that it did not have sufficient experience or funds to carry on with the project, said industry sources. ""Unfortunately, the Pemex budget is always a shadowy mystery,"" said a person close to the project who asked not to be named. ""There is no transparency or certainty regarding when they do and do not honor payment commitments."" Zama is a shallow-water field unified in 2022 between Pemex area AE-152-Uchukil and the discovery made in 2017 by a consortium led by US oil company Talos Energy. Pemex holds 50.4pc of the Zama project while Talos and Slim's subsidiary Grupo Carso have 17.4pc, German company Wintershall Dea 17.4pc and British company Harbour Energy 12.4pc. The state-owned company expects to spend $370.8mn to develop Zama in 2025, 64pc less than the original $1.05bn budget proposed by Pemex for next year, according to data from CNH. The regulator cleared the change last week, but commissioners questioned the CNH staff about the new delays. Pemex's original development plan showed that the company forecast the first crude production by December 2025, with 2,000 b/d and about 4mn cf/d of gas. The original plan forecast Zama hitting peak production of 180,000 b/d in 2029, making it Mexico's second-largest crude producer, only under the Maloob field. President Claudia Sheinbaum and Pemex's new new chief executive Victor Rodriguez flagged the importance of shallow-water field Zama and ultra deep field Trion to support Pemex's oil production target of 1.8mn b/d in the upcoming six years in a presentation last week. Pemex's new plan is focused on feeding its own refining system rather than crude exports. The company expects to increase gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production by 343,000 b/d, according to the plan, but it did not give a timeline. Pemex produced 491,000 b/d of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in the first nine months of 2024. Mexico's proposed 2025 federal budget also shows lower spending for Zama, at Ps3.1bn ($154mn) for 2025, even less than the figure approved by CNH on 14 November. Neither Pemex not Talos responded to requests for additional comment. ""Zama is the story of the triumph of ideology over practicality,"" said a Pemex source who asked not to be named. The state-owned company is studying how to bring in new investors to the project once congress approves secondary laws to implement recent energy reforms, the source said. But uncertainty over the legal framework and the general deterioration of Mexico's business climate will make this more difficult, the Pemex source added. The involvement of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who acquired 49.9pc of Talos Energy share in Zama last year, brought new hopes that work at Zama could finally accelerate. Instead, Slim's entrance slowed the project, as the new partner had to review the project, a former regulator who asked not to be named said. Talos Energy, the lead operator when the field was discovered over seven years ago, is now ""frustrated"" by the poor progress of the project. ""We have Mexico, a great discovery in Zama, we're seven years into it, and still have not made a final investment decision on it,"" said Talos Energy interim chief executive Joseph Mills, in a conference call with investors last week. ""So a lot of frustration there, as you can imagine.""

Within hours, the nation of 12 million people saw a rapidly moving scenario in which the troops seemed to take control of the government of President Luis Arce. He vowed to stand firm and named a new army commander, who immediately ordered the troops to stand down.

Soon the soldiers pulled back, along with a line of military vehicles, ending the rebellion after just three hours. Hundreds of Arce’s supporters then rushed the square outside the palace, waving Bolivian flags, singing the national anthem and cheering.

The soldiers' retreat was followed by the arrest of army chief Gen. Juan José Zúñiga, after the attorney general opened an investigation.

Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo said that in addition to Zúñiga, former navy Vice Adm. Juan Arnez Salvador was taken into custody.

“What was this group’s goal? The goal was to overturn the democratically elected authority,” del Castillo told journalists in announcing the arrests.

Late Wednesday, Defense Minister Edmundo Novillo said “everything is now under control.” Surrounded by the new military chiefs appointed by Arce, Novillo said that Bolivia lived a “failed coup.”

The apparent coup attempt came as the country has faced months of tensions and political fights between Arce and his one-time ally, former leftist president Evo Morales, over control of the ruling party. It also came amid a severe economic crisis.

The clashes have paralyzed the government’s efforts to deal with the economic crisis. For example, Morales’ allies in Congress have consistently thwarted Arce’s attempts to take on debt to relieve some of the pressure.

Zúñiga referenced that paralysis during the rebellion, telling reporters the military was tired of the infighting and was seeking “to restore democracy.”

“We are listening to the cry of the people because for many years an elite has taken control of the country,” he said, adding that politicians are “destroying the country: look at what situation we are in, what crisis they have left us in.”

“The armed forces intend to restore the democracy, to make it a true democracy,"" he said.

The rapidly unfolding crisis began in the early afternoon as the streets of La Paz started filling with soldiers. Arce tweeted that the troops deployment was irregular and soon he and other political figures warned of an attempted coup.

Still, the apparent attempt to depose the sitting president seemed to lack any meaningful support, and even Arce’s rivals closed ranks to defend democracy and repudiate the uprising.

In a twist, Zúñiga claimed in comments to journalists before his arrest that Arce himself told the general to storm the palace in a political move. “The president told me: ‘The situation is very screwed up, very critical. It is necessary to prepare something to raise my popularity’,” Zúñiga quoted the Bolivian leader as saying.

Zúñiga said he asked Arce if he should “take out the armored vehicles?” and Arce replied, “Take them out.”

Justice Minister Iván Lima denied Zúñiga’s claims, saying the general was lying and trying to justify his actions for which he said he will face justice.

Prosecutors will seek the maximum sentence of 15 to 20 years in prison for Zúñiga, Lima said via the social media platform X, “for having attacked democracy and the Constitution.”

The spectacle shocked Bolivians, no stranger to political unrest; in 2019 Morales was ousted as president following an earlier political crisis.

As the crisis unfolded Wednesday, Arce confronted Zúñiga in the palace hallway, as shown on video on Bolivian television. “I am your captain, and I order you to withdraw your soldiers, and I will not allow this insubordination,” Arce said.

Surrounded by ministers, he added: “Here we are, firm in Casa Grande, to confront any coup attempt. We need the Bolivian people to organize.”

Less than an hour later, Arce announced new heads of the army, navy and air force amid the roar of supporters, and thanked the country’s police and regional allies for standing by him. Arce said the troops who rose against him were “staining the uniform” of the military.

“I order all that are mobilized to return to their units,"" said the newly named army chief José Wilson Sánchez. “No one wants the images we’re seeing in the streets.”

Shortly after, the armored vehicles roared out of the plaza, tailed by hundreds of military fighters as police in riot gear set up blockades outside the government palace.

The incident was met with a wave of outrage by other regional leaders, including the Organization of American States, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, the leader of Honduras, and former Bolivian leaders.

Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy focusing on Latin America at Cornell University, said it’s important that world leaders and organizations keep up their condemnation of the coup attempt as developments unfold.

“If we allow the interruption of the constitutional order to take place in Bolivia, it could serve a demonstration effect,” Flores-Macias said from New York in an interview with The Associated Press. “It could send a signal that if this is OK to happen in Bolivia, it could happen elsewhere.”

Bolivia has seen intensifying protests in recent months over the economy’s precipitous decline from one of the continent’s fastest-growing two decades ago to one of its most crisis-stricken.

Arce and Morales have been battling for the future of Bolivia’s splintering Movement for Socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of elections in 2025.

Following Wednesday's chaos, reports on local media showed Bolivians stocking up on food and other essentials in supermarkets, concerned about what will come next.

According to TV Globo, the ruler of the neighboring country does not plan, during his stay on national soil, to meet his counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Milei is expected to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), scheduled for July 6-7.

The event includes conferences by right-wing and far-right politicians such as former president Jair Bolsonaro.

Given the announcement of prioritizing his participation in the forum in Camboriú, the diplomat declared that her country regrets Milei’s decision not to attend the Summit of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), which begins on Monday in Paraguay.

“Politically, it is regrettable that he is not present, but it is a sovereign decision,” clarified Padovan, who assured that “Mercosur is a mechanism that is very consolidated” and the absence of a president does not affect the integration process built by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, to which Bolivia now joins, in the process of accession.

If he goes to the forum, it would be Milei’s first visit to Brazil since he took power last December.

Diplomats heard by TV Globo evaluate that the position of the controversial Argentine economist is clear: focus on internal politics and greetings to the local and global right, while traditional diplomacy and relations with international blocs and organizations are in charge of representatives.

For the Planalto Palace, headquarters of the Executive Branch in this capital, Milei’s option for a meeting with Bolsonaro and an absence from the Mercosur Summit may reinforce the distance with Lula.

The two never met in a bilateral meeting, although Brazil and Argentina are the continent’s main trading partners.

In June, Lula and Milei were together in Italy at the G7 Summit, a group of the most industrialized countries in the world, made up of Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union, but they did not meet. They gathered alone.

The libertarian leader was in Brazil on Sunday, preparing to headline the country's version of CPAC, the conservative political action conference, alongside former President Javier Bolsonaro in Brazil's southern city of Balneario Camboriu.

In skipping the Mercosur trade bloc summit in Paraguay and sidling up to Bolsonaro just days after federal police indicted the right-wing populist in a scheme to embezzle Saudi diamonds, Milei delivered another harsh rebuke to Brazil's left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, escalating a risky feud with his country's biggest trading partner.

It was the latest example of Milei's provocative foreign policy, courting the global spotlight through friendships with hard-right allies rather than following diplomatic convention.

Bolsonaro on Sunday posted a video in which he greeted Milei with a hearty hug and a slap on the back before huddling with him and his sister and adviser, Karina Milei, among other aides. The two men stood beside their respective national flags for a photo-op that would have looked presidential had Bolsonaro not been a disgraced ex-president under police investigation for his alleged attempt to subvert Brazil's 2022 election result.

The night before, Bolsonaro opened the Brazilian CPAC Saturday with a fiery speech declaring his desire to see former U.S. President Donald Trump return to the White House next year. He and Milei were spotted together in a downtown hotel lobby littered with drained wine glasses later that night, watching Uruguay kick Brazil out of the 2024 Copa America.

Since the irascible Milei rode to power last December on a promise to fix Argentina's worst economic crisis in two decades, relations between the long-time allies and commodity powerhouses have rapidly deteriorated. Milei has branded Lula a “communist"" and refused to deal with him. Lula has given Milei the cold shoulder and demanded an apology for what he called Milei's “nonsense.”

The ideological enemies crossed paths for the first time at the Group of Seven summit last month in Italy, where their efforts to avoid each other as much as physically possible grabbed local headlines.

Experts say that mingling on the sidelines of the South American trade bloc meeting on Monday would have offered Milei a low-stakes opportunity to defuse tensions with Brazil, which buys nearly a sixth of Argentina’s exports, supplies most of Argentina's auto industry and backs its neighbor's bids to get badly needed aid from International Monetary Fund.

Instead, Milei has doubled down on a foreign policy gamble that experts have criticized as misguided.

“He seems to be shooting himself in the foot,” Michael Shifter, a scholar of Latin America at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said of Milei. “It's shocking and counterproductive for him to thumb his nose at Lula in this way because there could be a lot of cost for Argentina, that could affect his ability to carry out his policies.”

The president's ideologically driven strategy set off a political storm earlier this year in Spain, the second-largest foreign investor in Argentina, as Milei shunned meetings with the socialist government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and instead gave a speech bashing socialism at a far-right rally organized by the country's Vox Party.

The snub spiraled into a diplomatic crisis between the historic allies when Milei called Sánchez's wife corrupt and Spain pulled its ambassador from Buenos Aires.

Despite five trips to the United States since taking office, Milei has yet to enter the White House — he has hugged Trump at CPAC in Washington, bonded over his love of free markets in Texas with billionaire Tesla executive Elon Musk and met top tech CEOs in Silicon Valley.

“He wants to present himself as a rockstar of international politics which does generate admiration in some sectors of Argentina,” said Fabio Rodriguez, director at Buenos Aires-based consultancy M&R Asociados. “But already polls indicate that this may be changing, that people are seeing this as a liability, feeling abandoned in the sense that their president spends his time on tour while things are not improving on a daily basis.”

This time with Brazil — Latin America's biggest economy with a population of some 200 million — experts say the stakes are even higher. Pressures are building in Argentina, where the local currency last week touched a historic low of 1,430 pesos per dollar on the black market, where Argentines sell their depreciating pesos.

LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's embattled president on Monday announced the discovery of vast natural gas reserves, describing it as the biggest find in nearly two decades that could help the cash-strapped country reverse its falling production.

President Luis Arce called the trove just north of the capital a “mega field,"" saying it has some 1.7 trillion cubic meters of gas at a likely market value of $6.8 billion.

He said the field — named Mayaya X-1 — is way to revive the gas industry. That was the engine of robust growth in the early 2000s, a period of booming exports and declining poverty that experts have termed Bolivia’s “economic miracle.”

“This marks the beginning of a new chapter for the northern sub-Andean region, offering hope of maintaining our country as an important gas exporter,” said Arce, who is the alleged target of a military coup attempt last month and the main focus of anger among Bolivians over shortages of fuel and foreign currency. ""It's the most important discovery since 2005.”

In more recent years, investment in exploration projects by Bolivia’s state-owned energy company has dwindled and natural gas extraction has faded fast.

Bolivian politicians spent much of the gas windfall on lavishly subsidized fuel. The economic model pioneered by then President Evo Morales, Arce’s bitter political rival, quickly became unsustainable when commodity prices fell.

In a warning for the government, the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade reported last year that the country — once among the world’s top 10 natural gas producers — had become a net importer of hydrocarbons, spending $2.9 billion on diesel imports while earning only $2 billion from natural gas exports.

Last month, Arce described production as having “hit rock bottom.""

Bolivia's state-controlled energy company, Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos, or YPFB, said Monday that the newly announced natural gas field was discovered thanks to a $50 million investment.

The field, it said, covers several regions north of La Paz, the administrative capital, and will add to Bolivia’s existing gas reserves, which stood at 8.7 trillion cubic meters in 2019. There has been no publicly available data since.

6 minutes

By Mariela Nava, Mircely Guanipa and Vivian Sequera

CARACAS/MARACAIBO/MARACAY, Venezuela (Reuters) -Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said on Monday the country’s opposition has 73.2% of the voting tallies from Sunday’s election, allowing it to prove election results it says give it a victory.

The national electoral authority has proclaimed incumbent President Nicolas Maduro the winner of the vote, giving him a third term in office and extending 25 years of socialist party rule.

But independent pollsters called that result implausible, and opposition leaders and foreign observers urged the electoral authority to release vote tallies.

The tallies in possession of the opposition showed a total of 2.75 million votes for Maduro and 6.27 million for his rival, former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez, Machado said.

The numbers were sharply different to the 5.15 million votes the electoral authority said Maduro had won, compared to 4.45 million for Gonzalez.

Witnesses assigned to observe vote counts have a right to a copy of each voting machine’s tally, but the opposition said overnight that some witnesses were blocked from following counts and that at other sites the tallies were not printed.

The opposition has long warned about whether the vote would be fair, saying decisions by officials and the arrests of opposition staff were meant to create obstacles.

The electoral authority said just after midnight Maduro had won 51% of the vote. Later it proclaimed Maduro president for 2025 to 2031, adding he had won “the majority of valid votes.”

Governments in Washington and elsewhere cast doubt on the results and called for a full tabulation of votes.

Independent exit polls pointed to 65% support for Gonzalez and between 14% and 31% backing for Maduro.

At least two people were killed in connection with the vote count or protests – one overnight in the border state of Tachira and another in Maracay on Monday.

Protesters gathered in towns and cities across Venezuela on Monday, including near the presidential palace in Caracas.

Gonzalez has repeatedly warned against bloodshed.

But Maduro, whose 2018 re-election is considered fraudulent by the United States and others, said in evening remarks on state television that paid agitators had assaulted electoral agency offices.

“We know how to confront this situation and how to defeat those who are violent,” Maduro said.

Jorge Rodriguez, a ruling party lawmaker and Maduro’s campaign manager, called for supporters to march in support of the government on Tuesday.

Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino warned against allowing a repeat of the “terrible situations of 2014, 2017 and 2019”. Anti-government protesters took to the streets those years and hundreds were killed.

Machado had called on the country’s military to uphold the results of the vote. The armed forces have long supported Maduro and there have been no public signs leaders were breaking from the government.

Machado also called on supporters to gather on Tuesday in front of United Nations offices in Caracas.

PROTESTS TURN VIOLENT

Protesters gathered in towns and cities across Venezuela, with the Venezuelan Conflict Observatory saying it had registered 187 protests in 20 states.

“We’re fed up with this, we want freedom,” motorcycle taxi driver Fernando Mejia, 41, said as he marched in Maracay.

The street protests followed earlier “cacerolazo” demonstrations – a traditional Latin American protest in which people bang pots and pans – throughout the country.

In the Caracas neighborhood of El Valle and the city of Maracay, police fired tear gas, while protesters blocked a part of a major in Barquisimeto.

In Coro, the capital of Falcon state, protesters tore down a statue depicting late president Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s mentor.

An opposition adviser said on social media that security forces had made two failed attempts to enter the Argentine embassy in Caracas where he and five others have been living since March after warrants were issued for their arrests.

Many Venezuelan voters despaired at news of another six-year term for Maduro, who has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population and sanctions imposed by the United States and others which have crippled an already struggling oil industry.

“Maduro yesterday shattered my greatest dream, to see my only daughter again, who went to Argentina three years ago,” said retiree Dalia Romero, 59, in Maracaibo. “I stayed here alone with breast cancer so that she could work there and send me money for treatment.”

“Now I know that I’m going to die alone without seeing her again,” she said through tears.

INTERNATIONAL REACTION

U.S nonprofit the Carter Center, which sent observers for the vote, called on the electoral authority to immediately publish the results by polling station.

A source said further information from the group would not be released until its final report.

Biden administration officials accused the government of “electoral manipulation”. They did not announce any new punitive measures but left open the door to additional sanctions.

Brazil and the European Union called for transparency over polling data.

Venezuela’s bonds and those of state oil firm PDVSA fell deeper into distressed territory on Monday.

Venezuela’s attorney general Tarek Saab said the results had been delayed by an attack on the electoral system from North Macedonia. He did not offer any evidence.

Asylum requests. Consular procedures. In both Buenos Aires and Caracas, it’s all up in the air after a post-electoral diplomatic dispute saw President Nicolás Maduro recall Venezuela’s diplomatic personnel from Argentina and expel their Caracas counterparts.

Argentine diplomats left Venezuela on Thursday. Brazil took over the compound in Caracas and will be in charge of representing Argentina’s interests in Venezuela. This means the Brazilian Foreign Ministry is now responsible for the six Venezuelan opposition aides who have been living in the Argentine embassy seeking asylum since March.

However, the aides aren’t the only ones whose future is hanging in the balance. The departure of Venezuelan diplomatic personnel from Buenos Aires is also causing major disruption for many of the 220,000 Venezuelans living in Argentina.

‘It leaves citizens vulnerable’

On Tuesday night, hundreds of Venezuelans gathered outside their embassy in Buenos Aires to protest Sunday’s election results. Venezuelan authorities claimed that President Nicolás Maduro had won a third straight term. However, the Venezuelan opposition has claimed the ballot was fraudulent, and leaders around the world have refused to recognize the results, calling on the government to publish the electoral records so the numbers can be verified.

The embassy building was mostly empty, a source close to the matter told the Herald. One of its windows, shattered after someone threw a rock at it during Sunday night’s protests, had not been fixed. On Tuesday, a sign was posted to the riot fencing outside the building saying that the Venezuelan embassy would not be providing services until further notice because of the “violent actions generated in the surroundings” after the elections.

“The consular corps has already left and all the paperwork is still left inside,” said Enrique Lozada García, the press representative in Argentina for opposition leader María Corina Machado and candidate Edmundo González Urrutia. “There is no explanation as to how appointments can be granted.”

Charbel Najm, co-founder of Alianza por Venezuela, an NGO assisting Venezuelan migrants in Argentina, said the community of 220,000 Venezuelan migrants in Argentina will not be able to obtain their passports.

“There is a lot of uncertainty,” Najm added. “As of today, all consular procedures have been suspended. We have been told that some administrative staff will stay but we are still not sure that consular procedures usually carried out here will continue. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has not yet said how those procedures will be carried out.”

“The isolation of Venezuela not only isolates the regime but also leaves its citizens vulnerable,” Najm added.

Ana Sofía Moreno, a 32-year-old Venezuelan video editor living in Argentina, said the situation frustrated her father’s plans to visit his home country. “He was supposed to travel on August 18 and he had to pick up an authorization from the embassy since his passport has expired,” she told the Herald.

Recent social media posts for SAIME, the government’s processing system, are full of questions from Venezuelans, but the only answers are from their fellow users. “What happens if I need authorization to travel and the embassy is closed?” Moreno asked. “There is no way — you’ll have to go to another country for that,” a user wrote. Moreno has yet to receive an official response.

Others said their birth certificates and passports were in the building and now they could not access them. Some, however, said they did not use the embassy’s services even before it closed.

“Most Venezuelans do not have a valid passport. I have not updated it because I won’t give money to the regime,” one of the demonstrators told the Herald. Most said that Venezuelan passports were too expensive. Others did not want to alert the government to the fact that they were living in Argentina.

The mood outside the embassy was both hopeful and somber. Venezuelans waved flags and sang the national anthem, interspersed with chants of “This government has already fallen!” Two men dressed up as Argentine President Javier Milei were received with cheers, and some demonstrators initially thought they were in the presence of the man himself. They held a minute’s silence for those killed during the protests in their home country. One woman held a sign calling for the U.S. to invade Venezuela.

Difficult days

Sitting on the balcony in Caracas surrounded by three other opposition activists, Magalli Meda smiled.

“These have been very difficult days. But, well, it’s part of making the truth be respected. We are very proud. Venezuela needs a change,” she told journalists outside the building, which had a plaque reading “Embassy of the Argentine Republic” and a Brazilian flag next to it.

Meda is one of the six aides who has been living in the Argentine embassy since March 20, seeking political asylum. She described days of fear and uncertainty. Maduro gave Argentine diplomats 72 hours to leave, but even before the period expired, the six aides feared that the Venezuelan government would attack the embassy in the middle of the escalating violence. Police forces surrounded the building on Wednesday, Machado said in a post on X. On Tuesday, the Argentine Foreign Ministry said the Venezuelan government had cut power to the building.

Although Brazilian personnel are now in charge of the embassy, their fate is an open question. The refugees were under the protection of the Argentine government, leaving them in limbo going forward.

“They are still living there under diplomatic protection,” Lozada García, the opposition press spokesperson, told the Herald. Safe conduct out of the country is still under negotiation, he said.

On Wednesday, the U.S. embassy in Venezuela called for the request for safe conduct to receive “immediate approval,” saying that “threats and persecution against members of the democratic opposition sheltered in the Argentine embassy in Caracas must stop.”

Paraguay, El Salvador, and Brazil are part of the negotiations to get the asylum seekers out of the country. However, Maduro has thus far refused to give guarantees, accusing the opposition of leading a “coup d’etat” and claiming his government has been subject to a “cyber attack.”","Chaos in BA and Caracas as Argentina, Venezuela recall diplomats","In both Buenos Aires and Caracas, it’s all up in the air after a post-electoral diplomatic dispute saw President Nicolás Maduro recall Venezuela’s diplomatic personnel from Argentina and expel their Caracas counterparts.

""The mission of the Artificial Intelligence Unit Applied To Security (UIAAS) is the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crime and its connections through the use of artificial intelligence,"" the Ministry of Security resolution states – as translated by AI.

The UIASS is expected to monitor the public internet and dark web to investigate crimes and identify perpetrators, to conduct image analysis, to analyze security camera video in real time, and to ""use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical crime data to predict future crimes and help prevent them,"" among other responsibilities.

It is hard to find any social media predictive policing technologies that actually work at scale

As noted by El País, Argentina's government, in the midst of cutting public agencies, is creating a new public agency to predict crimes, a notion made famous in Minority Report, sci-fi author's Philip K. Dick's cautionary tale about persecuting people for things they haven't done.

However, the Argentine Ministry of Security cites a different source of inspiration: ""Countries such as the United States of America, China, the United Kingdom, Israel, France, Singapore, India, among others, are pioneers in the use of artificial intelligence in their areas of government and security forces.""

Andrew Ferguson, professor of law at American University in Washington DC, and author of ""The Rise of Big Data Policing,"" told The Register that while he's unfamiliar with specific AI initiatives in Argentina, ""It is hard to find any social media predictive policing technologies that actually work at scale.""

The forecasts made in the context of predictive policing have been pretty poor, according a report from The Markup last year, which found that crime predictions generated in 2018 by Geolitica (since acquired by SoundThinking) for the Plainfield Police Department (PD) had a success rate of less than half a percent.

New York City has, incidentally, just started testing an AI-based weapon detector system in its subways.

In a social media post, The Center for Studies on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information at the University of Palermo in Buenos Aires expressed concern about the opacity of the Argentine government's technology acquisition and implementation, noting that in the past similar technology has been used to profile academics, journalists, politicians and activists.

Not all predictive software is necessarily inaccurate or rights-trampling. University of Chicago researchers in 2022 claimed they had developed an 90 percent accurate algorithm to predict where crimes will occur a week in advance. The study also revealed that crime in wealthier areas results in more arrests than crime in disadvantaged areas – an institutional flaw more than a technical one.

Academics from Argentina and Europe, however, consider Prometea, a predictive AI system developed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the City of Buenos Aires, to be a success story. In a 2020 report, authors Juan G. Corvalán and Enzo Maria Le Fevre Cervini claim Prometea ""predicts the solution to a judicial case in less than 20 seconds with a 96 percent success rate"" and that ""it allows the drafting of 1000 judicial sentences related to housing rights in only 45 days; in the traditional way this would take 174 days.""

On a related note, a 2021 study [PDF] of AI readiness in five Latin American countries says that IBM, Accenture, and Oracle, asked to develop Prometea, estimated the project would cost $100,000. Corvalán, deputy prosecutor of the Buenos Aires public prosecutor's office at the time, reportedly said that officials instead looked inward and paid an internal developer 33,000 pesos (~$500 given a 2020 exchange rate of 0.015) to make the first version of the software.

A 2021 survey of predictive police and crime control in the US claimed that while AI systems can suffer from inaccuracy, high cost, bias, and other limitations, ""there is consensus by the majority of the researchers on the importance of predictive algorithms on the policing landscape."" ®

Value-wise, January-to-June exports grossed USD 4.63 billion, sliding down 10.3% compared to the same period last year. ABPA president Ricardo Santin said that despite the fall, data shows a stability. He said export figures from last year’s March were so exceptionally high they skewed the industry’s average in the period.

Ricardo Santin: Growth to Muslim-majority countries is expected to be maintained. They are some of the leading buyers of chicken from Brazil

The top buyer from Brazil was China, accounting for 11% of the industry’s imports. It was followed by the United Arab Emirates at 10%, Japan at 8%, Saudi Arabia at 8%, South Africa at 7%, Philippines at 5%, and Iraq at 4%.

Sales to Arab countries grew. In the H1, the UAE imported USD 478.3 million worth of chicken from Brazil, up 16.5% from the same period last year. Saudi Arabia imported USD 431.6 million, up 5% from 2023’s H1.

Sales to Iraq grew at 28.3% year on year, reaching USD 231.9 million. Arab countries that bought more also included Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Jordan. Bahrain and Yemen purchased less.

Instabilities influence chicken exports

Santin credits the expansion in sales to the Middle East to regional instabilities. “In times of tension in the region, countries step up purchases to build stocks,” said the ABPA’s executive. “As a bloc, Middle East and North Africa [MENA] countries are our top customer and are expected to keep growing. Exports to the MENA region grew 15.2% and are expected to remain on that level,” he said.

“We expect they remain our leading client as bloc. Muslim-majority countries in general are major importers from us”, he added.

Luís Rua underscored the good moment of sales to Algeria

ABPA’s Market director Luís Rua said Brazil has exported 10,000 tonnes to Algeria, a destination that was opened only last October, and said the top export to the North Africa country is whole chicken. He explained that there are animal size “ranges”, from 700 grams to 1.7 kilogram. Saudis, Rua exemplified, prefer smaller animals. UAE imports 1-1.2-kg animals. Consumers from Algeria, Egypt and Yemen favor 1.2-1.5-kg animals, and this helps cover the industry offer.

Santin said Brazil was quick to contain the outbreak of the Newcastle disease, which stems from a virus circulating among wild pigeons but migrated to an animal at a farm in Anta Gorda municipality in southernmost state Rio Grande do Sul.

Despite having adopted internationally agreed-upon health protocols – informing buyer countries, self-banning exports, and taking other measures – chickens from the South American giant remain banned in Argentina, China, Mexico, and North Macedonia. Restrictions to imports from Rio Grande do Sul state are in force in Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Peru.

The estimated impact of these bans, said Santin, are at 50,000-60,000 tonnes. “The self-ban depends on us, but lifting the embargo depends on the importer. What we can do is disclosing our information as quickly as possible, and we’ve been doing that,” he said. “There’s no reason to maintain the ban,” he added.

Maduro was quickly recognized as the winner by Cuba, Nicaragua, Honduras and Bolivia, as well as Russia, China and Iran. But he got no recognition from nominally left-wing governments in the region's biggest countries: Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.

""The heavy-hitting diplomatic players in the region have demanded proof [of his win],"" said Christopher Hernandez-Roy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

""I think the three of them have realized that the level of fraud is just so astronomically huge that nobody in their right mind can believe this result, and so it would be very difficult for them to join the usual chorus of leftist governments congratulating Maduro for his victory.""

The Atlanta-based Carter Center, which had deployed observers in Venezuela, said on Tuesday evening that the election ""did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic.""

The U.S. and Canada have been somewhat subdued in their reactions to Maduro's claim of victory.

WATCH | Venezuelans talk about the chaos that has followed election: Venezuelans react to their country's election results, and the chaos that followed Duration 1:15 Many citizens spoke of the sadness they are feeling a day after the country's opposition and entrenched incumbent Nicolas Maduro both claimed victory in the presidential election.

Washington and Ottawa are calling on Venezuela to release detailed vote results, as is the European Union, but neither the U.S. nor Canada has yet formally declared rival candidate Edmundo González the winner.

The Trudeau government took a much more active role five years ago, when Juan Guaido emerged as a rival president to Maduro. Canada hosted the Venezuelan opposition in Ottawa and, with Peru, formed the Lima Group of countries that wanted to oust Maduro by peaceful means.

Lula demands receipts

Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — historically sympathetic to the socialist movement started by the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez — spoke on Tuesday with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the two let it be known they were in agreement in insisting Maduro provide proof of his claimed victory.

In Caracas, Lula's envoy Celso Amorim met with Maduro on Tuesday and pressured him to release full results. So far, the Maduro government has only released an aggregate number, with no poll-by-poll breakdown.

Later that day, Lula went on Brazil's Globo TV and said the solution to the Venezuelan impasse was simple: ""Present the voting records."" He added that ""those who aren't in agreement have the right to express themselves and prove why they don't agree, just as the government has the right to prove why it is correct.""

Colombia's Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo posted a video message on X in which he said that ""for the peace of Venezuela, it's necessary to know all the voting stations' final results, and that these be audited by the world.""

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) of Mexico warned against outside interference and refrained from criticizing the Venezuelan leader directly, but also called for transparency and the release of detailed vote counts, as did his chosen successor and president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum.

Those demanding detailed documentation are aware the Maduro government almost certainly will not be able to substantiate its claims with returns from voting machines.

The Venezuelan opposition, however, says it won the election by a wide margin and that it has the receipts to prove it.

Paper trail of votes

The election took place at more than 30,000 individual polling tables, each of which produced its own electronic vote. Those counts were reproduced on paper receipts called ""actas"" marked with a unique QR code and alphanumeric signature. By law, volunteer scrutineers are entitled to a copy.

The opposition — which was much more organized and unified than in the past — recruited tens of thousands of scrutineers to monitor the election across the country, and says it was able to obtain actas from almost all polling stations, which it has been rapidly uploading online.

As of midnight Tuesday, 81 per cent of all actas had been digitized, giving Edmundo González more than seven million votes and Maduro less than half that.

""We have the records showing our categorical and mathematically irreversible victory,"" said González, a 73-year-old retired diplomat who stepped up after Venezuela's electoral commission banned opposition leader Maria Corina Machado from running.

""It's a two-to-one margin, which is what local pollsters and international polling companies like Clear Path Strategies and Edison Research had been showing ahead of the vote,"" said Hernandez-Roy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Some were saying that the opposition would get somewhere between 65 and 70 sort of per cent of the vote. Others said simply that Edmundo González was up at least 25 points ahead of Maduro. So this is consistent with polling.""

Diplomatic tensions

As the opposition uploaded actas on Tuesday morning, Peru recognized González as president-elect.

Within hours, Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Peru and six other Latin American countries, ordering them to close their embassies and withdraw their diplomats. All had alleged or implied there was fraud in Sunday's vote count.

Among them was Chile, whose socialist President Gabriel Boric stated on his X account ""the results announced by the Maduro regime are difficult to believe.""

At time of publication, many diplomats from the seven countries affected by expulsions remained in Caracas.

Argentina's President Javier Milei has long been one of the fiercest critics of Chavismo.

""Argentina will not recognize another fraud,"" Milei warned on his X account, ""and hopes that this time the armed forces will defend democracy and the popular will.""

The most dramatic situation since Sunday occurred at the Argentinian embassy in Caracas, which remains surrounded by masked agents of the Maduro government. Diplomats inside the embassy say electricity has been cut off.

Members of Machado's campaign team had sought sanctuary in the embassy. On Monday night, soon after the rupture in diplomatic relations, the embassy was surrounded by ""colectivos,"" an informal militia of ruling Socialist Party who wear street clothes and are often armed.

Maduro responded by saying, ""Traitor, coward, you couldn't go a round with me,"" adding Milei was ""a Nazi fascist"" with the face of a monster.

Arrests begin

Rallies in Caracas by both sides on Tuesday afternoon seemed to confirm the Maduro government has lost the streets.

Senior government figures said opposition leaders Machado and González would be arrested, but that had not happened by time of publication.

The opposition says one of its leaders, Freddy Superlano, was taken from a house in Caracas by masked men in black uniforms. Less prominent figures of the opposition experienced similar abductions in various parts of the country.

By evening, there were unconfirmed reports that arrest warrants had already been signed for Machado and González.

Arresting Machado would not be a simple operation. She is often accompanied by a volunteer escort of hundreds of motorcycles or large crowds of sympathizers, a tactic that her campaign perfected while touring Venezuela during the campaign.

All eyes on armed forces

The next steps for the Venezuelan government and opposition remain uncertain.

The socialist movement started by Hugo Chavez — once popular with the majority of voters — began to lose the streets of Venezuela a decade ago, when Chavez died, and that process now seems complete. But Maduro still controls the armed forces.

Both sides are watching for any change in that situation.

Machado has openly harangued members of the security forces to switch sides, so far with little success. But two army captains published a video yesterday calling on their fellow soldiers to back her.

""The time has come to take the correct decisions for this historic moment,"" said Capt. Javier Nieto. ""It's evident that we have a new president-elect.""

The loyalties of the rank-and-file are uncertain, and the government has been reluctant to test them by ordering them to fire on crowds that could contain their own friends and family.

""The security forces are not monolithic,"" said Hernandez-Roy. ""Your average Venezuelan soldier or your average policeman is also struggling with meeting the basic necessities of life and and feeding their family.""

Maduro has warned that his United Socialist Party won't leave power without a ""fratricidal civil war."" Machado told a large crowd yesterday that the opposition ""won't negotiate results. The only thing we'll negotiate is the transition.""

The stage is set for a huge and possibly violent confrontation.","As Venezuela courts chaos, some of Maduro's allies demand receipts of election win","Canada hosted the Venezuelan opposition in Ottawa and, with Peru, formed the Lima Group of countries that wanted to oust Maduro by peaceful means.

In an opening ceremony for Phase II, which took place at Hospital Materno Infantil Villa Choferes del Chaco in Filadelfia, July 31, U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay Marc Ostfield emphasized the critical need for medical support in the region, and highlighted the success of Phase I, which took place the previous two weeks across four medical facilities in the northern El Chaco region of Paraguay and concluded July 25.





""In the last two weeks, the AMISTAD24 team provided medical care to over 700 patients, gaining valuable experience working alongside the dedicated staff of the local hospitals and clinics,"" Ostfield said. ""My gratitude goes to the … staff for welcoming our teams.""

During Phase I of AMISTAD24, primarily U.S. Air Force Reserve Airmen and U.S. Army Massachusetts National Guard Soldiers provided direct medical care to 735 Paraguayan patients, many of whom belong to the local indigenous population of Guarani who call the region home, in a total force effort that set the stage for continued operations and the new team's arrival.

""One of our main takeaways from the first two weeks of AMISTAD is how warmly we have been welcomed by our Paraguayan partners. The medical staff and interpreters we have worked with so far in our time here have been exceptional, and it's inspiring to see our U.S. team work so closely with them in creative ways to address the needs of the local patient population,"" said U.S. Air Force Col. Brittany Nutt, AMISTAD24 mission troop commander.

One of the main emphases for Phase II of AMISTAD24, which did not occur in Phase I, will be performing surgeries, ranging from small surgeries that are more superficial to large, complex abdominal surgeries that require operating with more in-depth procedures and equipment.

Key to enabling these surgeries is the shipment of approximately $1 million in medical supplies and operating and intensive care unit equipment in a containerized unit, which arrived at Paraguay via commercial air and accompanied the 13-member U.S. Army 759th Forward Resuscitative Surgical Detachment (Airborne), assigned to the 44th Medical Brigade at Fort Liberty, North Carolina.

In typical operations, the surgical team deploys with the containerized unit of supplies and uses it in austere environments to aid Army paratroopers in airborne operations, said U.S. Army Capt. Connor Dial, 759th FRSD executive officer.

However, it is unique to send a container of medical equipment abroad to outfit operating rooms for a medical assistance mission.

""This equipment that we brought is critical because this is what we train on, this is what we know, our standard is to be able to … push the equipment out of a plane, jump out of the plane, and set it up in 30 minutes. Having it here [in Paraguay] and knowing the equipment here is important for us to get comfortable performing our mission in a different environment,"" Dial said.

While providing surgeries in Filadelfia, the joint U.S. medical personnel participating in Phase II of AMISTAD24 will also provide optometry, primary care services, and emergency medical services.

The team will continue to focus on both building partnership capacity with Paraguayan medical providers and providing mutually beneficial training which can ultimately increase the medical readiness of both countries and help address local health concerns.

The community has already benefited from Phase I of operations, said Paraguayan Dr. Lucia Figuerado, general director of Hospital Materno Infantil Villa Choferes del Chaco.

""We've even had questions from the community already, like, 'When will they come back?'… [The community] has received the medical attention they've been waiting for and everyone has responded the same way, that they are very happy because they have been well cared for.""","USAF, Army Medics Launch First Mission With Paraguay","""In the last two weeks, the AMISTAD24 team provided medical care to over 700 patients, gaining valuable experience working alongside the dedicated staff of the local hospitals and clinics,"" Ostfield said.

According to Caught Offside, Aston Villa could potentially sign Giovani Lo Celso for around €16 million. Tottenham are willing to let go of the Argentine playmaker for a cut-price fee as the 28-year-old has no place in Ange Postecoglou’s plans while Unai Emery sees a role for him.

Giovani Lo Celso price tag

Giovani Lo Celso managed to impress Ange Postecoglou briefly, but then he fell back into old habits at Tottenham, with the Argentine playmaker quickly shifting out of the manager’s plans. While he has qualities that Spurs need, he’s not necessarily part of the Australian’s plans going forward.

Tottenham are eager to cash in on him and are willing to sell him for a knocked-down fee. Spurs wanted a bit more than the €16 million they are demanding right now. Aston Villa is a key suitor in the chase for the 28-year-old, and Unai Emery is keen to work again with the midfielder.

Villa have gone through some drastic squad changes this summer, with the sales of Douglas Luiz and Moussa Diaby. They have made sufficient midfield signings to replace the former, but Emery feels the need to bring another profile that held in the attacking side and the middle.

Aston Villa and Spurs were in talks over a part-exchange deal involving Jacob Ramsey and Lo Celso, but that appears to be dead in the water. The 28-year-old Tottenham playmaker could still make a move should Villa consider the €16 million fee and pay up, with the Argentine reportedly open to the move.

Villa planning more singing

Should Villa manage to bring Lo Celso, they will continue to scour the market for important signings before the window shuts. Joao Felix remains another player, and as costly as he may be, Villa is willing to make the financial commitment to bring him, while Atletico Madrid is open to selling him.

Meanwhile, they are also looking to bolster their backline further, with Lutsharel Geertruida their latest target to improve the defence. Should they manage all those incomings, Villa will have a good enough squad to challenge for a top-four place again in the upcoming season, although, with consistency, they can even aim for a higher finish.",Aston Villa can sign Giovani Lo Celso for €16 million,"Aston Villa could sign midfield target Giovani Lo Celso in a cut-price deal as Tottenham are ready to dispense off with the Argentine.

Knight, 65, said he had found that the programme had a “pretty universal” reach, as people from “Buenos Aires to Eastern Europe” could understand its characters were “the same as anybody else”.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Knight said: “His (Dogg’s) manager Ted met me, and we went up to the room and he’d built this thing to smoke about a foot long.

Snoop Dogg is said to have told Steven Knight he related to Peaky Blinders (John Walton/PA)

“I’m drinking beer, Ted’s drinking gin, and we have this conversation and Snoop was saying that Peaky reminded him of how he got involved in gang culture, and in the south central and Detroit.

“But it was really interesting because it told me the story of his life and it was all about family.

“It was all about family keeping you in and escaping from family to do the bad stuff and then the family relocating their emotions and loyalties to follow you and then escaping again.

“He was such a great bloke, he was so nice to talk to, but it just made me understand that there is something in Peaky, that one has luckily come across, that is pretty universal, I think.”

He said he felt the show was relatable as it showed working class people as “larger than life” rather than viewing them from the perspective of “aren’t they hilarious or isn’t it a shame”.

Knight added that a lot of Peaky Blinders had come from stories his dad had told him from when he was a child.

The writer added: “Most things about working class people are like either, aren’t they hilarious, or isn’t it a shame.

“It’s not true, I think that misses the whole point, to see working class live from that perspective is so reductive.

“I experienced it with my dad when we used to go shoeing horses, like in the gypsy scrap metal yard, people that we would meet were just so larger than life, they were so rebellious.

“They were on the other side of the law, but they were but really warm, and great people.

“I know that sounds like a contradiction but I wanted to get some of that respect for one’s own life into this, that these are people are living big glamorous, dramatic lives, and that the emotions and passions of these people are the same as anybody else.

“And try to create what turned out to be fortunately, like a global landscape, where people in Eastern Europe, and people in Buenos Aires, and people in Rio are getting it and feeling the same thing.”

Along with Peaky Blinders, Knight is one of the three creators of the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game show, and has also written the screenplays for Dirty Pretty Things and The Detectives.

Venezuela’s opposition, claiming victory in presidential elections they say were stolen by strongman Nicolas Maduro, gathered in the thousands in Caracas and elsewhere on Saturday, vowing to fight “to the end”.

People rallied in several cities in Venezuela and as far afield as Spain, Belgium and Australia in response to a call by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado to join a “Protest for the Truth”.

Machado herself came out of hiding to lead a rally in the capital, seeking to intensify pressure on Maduro to concede what she and others say was an overwhelming win for opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia in July 28 polls.

“We won’t leave the streets,” Machado told thousands of demonstrators, many of whom waved the national flag and copies of election records from their voting stations as proof of an opposition victory.

“Peaceful protest is our right,” she said as demonstrators chanted “Liberty! Liberty!” and clamoured to get as near as possible to the wildly popular politician.

Authorities later confiscated the open-top truck that Machado uses as a stage at rallies, including on Saturday, according to an X post from her Comando Con Venezuela alliance.

Venezuela’s National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed Maduro the winner of a third six-year term until 2031, giving him 52% of votes cast but without providing a detailed breakdown of the results.

The opposition says polling station-level results show Gonzalez Urrutia took more than two-thirds of the vote.

He had replaced Machado on the ballot after she was barred from running by institutions loyal to the regime.

“This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear,” demonstrator Adriana Calzadilla, a 55-year-old teacher, told AFP in Caracas, where National Guard officers and police were out in force.

Another, 42-year-old economist Iliana Alvarean, conceded that she did “feel fear”.

“One does not stop feeling it, because of the repression,” she said. “But we want him (Maduro) out. We are here to the end.”

Jesus Aguilar, a 21-year-old theology student, said he turned out to support the opposition in hope of a better future: “We know that with this government there are no possibilities for growth. I’ve even seen myself trying to leave the country.”

In cities across the country, Venezuelans were in the streets. In Maracaibo, Venezuela’s once oil-rich city in the northwest, hundreds had gathered by 9am (1300 GMT).

“We have already been through the worst, we don’t have any more fear,” Noraima Rodriguez, 52, told Reuters. “My daughter died because there were no medical supplies in the university hospital. I have nothing to lose, but I want a future for my grandchildren.”

In the cities of Valencia, San Cristobal and Barquisimeto, hundreds demonstrated, many waving Venezuelan flags, protest signs or copies of voting tallies.

In Maracay, about 110km (70 miles) west of Caracas, about a hundred protesters were dispersed with tear gas.

No incidents were reported from the rallies, which took place under heavy security.

On Saturday Maduro accused Gonzalez Urrutia, who last appeared in public at a protest on July 30, of trying to flee the country.

“He’s hiding in a cave. And he’s preparing his escape from Venezuela. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia is taking the money and going to Miami,” Maduro told supporters at a rally outside the Miraflores presidential palace.

He has called for Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia to be arrested, accusing them of seeking to foment a “coup d’etat”.

Gonzalez Urrutia was defiant in a post on X earlier in the day: “We have the votes, the records, the support of the international community and Venezuelans determined to fight. It is time for an orderly transition.”

Anti-Maduro protests have claimed 25 lives so far, with nearly 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested since election day.

At one of the first overseas demonstrations to get underway on Saturday, more than 100 Venezuelans in Australia rallied in Sydney.

Thousands more protested across Spain, host to about 280,000 of the nearly eight million Venezuelans to have fled their country as the economy collapsed on the watch of Maduro, in office since 2013.

There were also rallies in Colombia, Mexico and Argentina where 34-year-old Andreina Escalante told AFP “we have faith that we will get out of the dictatorship”.

Holding her two-year-old daughter, she said her dream is to return to Venezuela which she left more than five years ago.

In downtown Mexico City, nearly 1,000 people gathered at the central Plaza de la Revolucion.

“This is the moment for a free Venezuela,” said Jesus Mata, 30, a street vendor who arrived in Mexico two years ago.

Motivated by economic and political crisis, he was among tens of thousands of Venezuelans to cross the treacherous jungle between Colombia and Panama known as the Darien Gap, notorious for robberies, kidnappings, rapes and other dangers.

“I hope for an end to 25 years of darkness, that there is freedom so that the almost 8mn Venezuelans who are outside the country can go back home,” he added.

Maduro’s victory claim has been rejected by the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries.

The international community has offered a raft of suggestions for overcoming the nearly three-week-old election crisis – including a new vote – but most have been rejected outright by both the ruling party and opposition.

However, thousands of his supporters gathered in Caracas and other cities on Saturday.

“The Venezuelan people have suffered too many blockades, too many attacks and this new attack we are going to beat,” 46-year-old community leader Aurimar Nieves told AFP, referring to sanctions imposed by the US.

The CNE says it has been unable to release the vote breakdown due to a “cyber terrorist attack” on its systems, though the Carter Centre observer mission said there was no evidence for such a claim.

The opposition says it has access to 80% of paper ballots cast, which show that Gonzalez Urrutia won handily.

Finds some hosts more welcoming than others

Colombian data protection authorities are the latest to wave a red flag in Worldcoin’s direction, tweeting out a warning that accuses the Cayman Islands-based Worldcoin Foundation and Worldcoin parent company Tools for Humanity of potentially violating the nation’s personal data protection regime. The company began collecting iris biometrics in Colombia in May. It currently hosts biometrics-scanning Orbs in 25 locations in Colombia.

The Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC)’s statement says “the purpose of the proceedings is to determine whether the investigated companies have infringed the Colombian personal data protection regime in the collection of sensitive personal data in relation to the implementation of personal data processing policies and privacy notices.

South America has not been especially welcoming to Worldcoin, of which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is a founder. Ecuador recently issued an alert related to “risks associated with the delivery of biometric data” to the company, not two months after it had set up shop there. The nation’s Superintendency of Companies cited “a lack of clarity regarding the use of this sensitive information” as its primary concern.

In Buenos Aires, Argentinian regulators fined Worldcoin Foundation 194 million pesos (roughly US$210,000) for failing to acquire accreditation as an identity services provider and for failing to post notice that the service is restricted to those of 18 years or older. The fine followed an inquiry by the Argentine Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) into the legality of Worldcoin’s data collection practices.The company was also accused of violating Argentina’s National Consumer Protection Law.

Wolrdcoin also discontinued its Orb operations in Brazil shortly after launching there. It remains to be seen how authorities in Peru respond.

But for South American regulators, at least for now, the verdict on the Worldcoin ecosystem’s current incarnation is that the digital ID project is too vague on key privacy details and not worth the risk.

Europe, for its part, has proven similarly skeptical of Worldcoin’s operations.

Korean survey, Malaysian deal pave way for foothold in Asia

In Asia, however, reception has been somewhat more cordial. A recent blog post from the company says it surveyed World ID holders in South Korea and found they expressed “overwhelming support for the Worldcoin project and proof of humanness.”

“Of the 1,100+ respondents, more than 9 in 10 agreed that technology that differentiates between humans and bots online, like World ID, is necessary. Additionally, 84 percent of respondents agreed that Korea should become a global hub for these kinds of innovations, demonstrating high expectations for the country in the age of AI.”

Elsewhere in Asia, Worldcoin recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Mimos Berhad, the applied research and development agency for the government of Malaysia, which includes the possibility of collaborating on manufacturing the company’s Orbs. And Singapore has seen line-ups for Worldcoin’s iris scanning service – although it also attracted a glance from Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Commission, which advised heightened caution when submitting biometrics through the Orb.

Of course, it would be remiss not to mention that South Korea’s data protection agency is still investigating Worldcoin, and that the firm’s Hong Kong offices were raided in January, leading to a subsequent ban on operating in the territory.

The company, however, is proving to be nothing if not persistent, and registration is currently open for Encode x Worldcoin Educate, a series of workshops on the innovation in the Worldcoin ecosystem, designed to “empower real-world applications and enhance user experience in the era of AI.”

They’re so crazy and exciting, and [the jockeys] risk their life every race.”

The central character, Remo Manfredini, is clearly psychologically damaged – abusing drugs and alcohol to the extent that we see him fall off his horse even before it leaves the gate – but nonetheless he retains the self-possession and panache of a matador. “There is a lot of pride in that attitude,” says the Argentine filmmaker, whose previous film “El Angel,” about a baby-faced killer, premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard.

Remo, played by Nahuel Pérez Biscayart, always keeps his race-track cronies at a distance and can seem aloof. “The only way I could relate to that is being a director in this industry and how you feel alienated and completely lost in relation to what everyone else is talking about and what it really is to make a movie, or ride a horse in his case,” he says.

“Kill the Jockey”

Talking about Pérez Biscayart, a Cesar winner with “120 BPM (Beats Per Minute),” Ortega says: “He’s the best Argentinian actor we have definitely. He’s on a completely different level. He’s a genius. He just understands the madness of everything, and he’s comfortable with being ridiculous.”

The film is imbued with a satirical tone that portrays Argentinian society as being a snake pit of corruption and violence. “I use that a lot because I just can’t take life too seriously if I want to get through it. That’s like a survival mode that is very useful for me, and I try to have the character have that point of view in order to get through all his own things,” he says.

Although set in Buenos Aires, the film isn’t a typical Argentine film. “I have this city in my blood, but I could have done this in Russia. It’s just people. It’s about people,” Ortega says. “So, I’m okay with the fact that it doesn’t belong anywhere. The D.P. is from Finland, Timo Salminen, and he’s done every Aki Kaurismäki film, and he gave a completely personal look to the film, and that was amazing. It just looks very particular, and it doesn’t look a lot like other Argentinian films. So, I’m okay with not having an identity in that respect.”

One of the surreal aspects of the film is the recurring appearance of babies. Remo’s mobster boss is always carrying a baby, and Remo’s girlfriend Abril – played by “Money Heist’s” Úrsula Corberó – is pregnant. This chimes with one of the film’s themes, which is how birth and death are linked, an idea borrowed from William S. Burroughs. “He talks about how there has to be death in order for there to be birth,” Ortega says.

The baby obsession also was driven by his own experience. “I was about to be a father, and I was very crazy about that. It was just something that was haunting me, you know, all the baby things,” he says.

It is one of the film’s ironies that Remo only finds freedom when he is incarcerated. “I guess when you’re not in the hassle of trying to fit in or having to relate to the world you live in, you free yourself from all these obligations and that happens naturally. I have friends that have been in prison, and that has happened to them. They became completely different people,” he says.

Next up for Ortega is a film about a crack-smoking priest in Bolivia. “It’s about a priest who meets a crazy actress, and they fall in love, and she gets him into smoking crack,” Ortega says. “Then he goes to Bolivia to work with the guys who work underground. They believe in God when they’re on the ground, and when they go underground, they have this statue of the Devil, because underground, that’s where the Devil reigns. So they believe in God and the Devil, and that’s a very interesting world. And there’s a lot of dynamite. You know, in Bolivia, they sell dynamite like you can buy cigarettes. And I love that. I love that.”

“Father Gabriele Amorth already decried that in the Church, in the 1980s, there were many bishops who did not believe in exorcisms or in the devil. John Paul II, but also Benedict XVI and Francis, supported this deliverance ministry through their speeches against the action of the evil one,” Marchese explained in an interview with ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

In his homilies, Pope Francis has repeatedly mentioned that “the devil enters through the pockets” in reference to the power of corruption.

Speaking with ACI Prensa, Marchese recalled his meeting with the pontiff in preparation for his book on exorcism. “Never dialogue with the devil, because he will win,” the Holy Father warned him.

“He makes you believe that everything is good, that you will be successful, and then he traps you, you fall into the abyss and then it’s difficult to get up again,” the expert recalled the pope saying.

Marchese, a Vatican journalist with Mediaset (Italian television) with more than 10 years of experience, wrote the book full of stories of victims of possession and testimonies of exorcists who fight against the devil, including a previously unpublished interview with Pope Francis in which he describes how the devil always “tries to attack everyone and sows discord, also in the Church, trying to pit one against another.”

Pope Francis, attacked by the devil

The pope admits in this interview that he too has been attacked by the devil, Marchese said. “The devil attacks everyone, but above all those in the hierarchy of the Church. He tempted Jesus and he also does the same with the popes and bishops.”

Indeed, in the first chapter of the book, Marchese tells the story of a nun who was freed from diabolic possession and who, during the exorcisms, with a demonic voice, indicated that the devil hated Pope Francis: “Have you seen everything I put that Argentine through?” the devil said to the priest. “But he doesn’t go away, he is strong, too much for me.”

“I asked the pope,” Marchese recalled, “did you know that the devil says that about you? And he answered me: ‘Perhaps because I annoy him with prayer and I follow the Gospel.’ At the same time, he is certainly pleased when I commit some sin. He seeks the downfall of man, but he has no hope when prayer is present.”

In some dioceses in northern Europe there are no exorcists despite the warnings of recent popes, Marchese noted in the interview with ACI Prensa. “Yes, unfortunately it’s like that, and I have to agree with Father Gabriele Amorth (1925–2016), who was a great exorcist.”

Some popes have performed remote exorcisms

Although some popes have performed remote exorcisms, such as Pius XII and St. John Paul II, there is no evidence that other contemporary pontiffs have done so. Even in times when the devil has manifested himself, such as when Benedict XVI blessed three demoniac youths from a distance after a general audience in 2009, popes have not carried out exorcisms.

St. John XXIII never performed exorcisms and neither did St. Paul VI, who in 1972 commented how “the smoke of Satan had entered through some crack” into the Church. Nor has Pope Francis performed an exorcism, as confirmed in the interview with Marchese, since he prefers that specialized priests do it.

His approach is focused on preventing and combating evil temptations through faith and prayer. The pontiff has not only openly preached against the devil, he also recognized the International Association of Exorcists in June 2014, Marchese noted.

In 2019, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) published the book “Rebuking the Devil,” which compiles Pope Francis’ most important teachings on the prince of lies, “his empty promises and works, and how he can be actively combated.”

“The pope tells us how to use powerful spiritual weapons against the devil, including the word of God and the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament,” wrote Bishop Michael F. Burbidge of the Diocese of Arlington, Virginia, at the presentation of the book.",Author says the last three popes have battled the devil,"In his homilies, Pope Francis has repeatedly mentioned that “the devil enters through the pockets” in reference to the power of corruption.
“Never dialogue with the devil, because he will win,” the Holy Father warned him.
“But he doesn’t go away, he is strong, too much for me.”“I asked the pope,” Marchese recalled, “did you know that the devil says that about you?

Claudia Piñeiro has spent over two decades penning fiction about the lives of women in Buenos Aires, where dark events—affairs, accidents, suicides, and murder—turn their worlds upside down.

Piñeiro weaves in the political backdrop of Argentina with the psyche of her characters, giving her stories a rich depth that has earned her accolades as a best-selling author, and the third most translated Argentine author behind Borges and Cortázar. This year, Netflix released a film adaptation of her Booker Shortlisted novel, Elena Knows, led by a stellar performance by Argentine A-lister, Mercedes Morán.

Piñeiro’s new book Time of the Flies is a sequel to her 2005 novel, All Yours. Her protagonist, Inés, has been released from prison after killing her husband’s lover—the murder which happened in All Yours. But soon after her release, Inés is asked to be complicit in another crime. She’s unsure whether she wants to go down that path again, despite the desperately needed reward money.

During this year’s Women in Translation Month (#WITMonth), Sounds and Colours spoke to Piñeiro about her subjects, writing process and why Buenos Aires is always at the heart of her books.

S&C: You’re often described as a crime writer—which I’ve always found quite strange given how broad the topics of your books are. How do you feel about the description?

CP: I was surprised when they first called me a crime writer. I write stories—in those stories, death appears.

We could say that my stories have certain elements of the detective genre—but in a way where the genre’s rules are subverted. For example, some say Elena Knows is a detective story. I believe the reader quickly understands what happened—the one who doesn’t know what happened is Elena herself.

In a detective story, one asks questions about the past— ‘Who killed them? And why?’ In Time of the Flies, the questions are about the future. ‘What will these women do? Will they accept the request? Will they go to jail again? If they kill someone, who will they kill?’

Sometimes I get invited to crime book conventions and I don’t mind that. Every reader has their interpretation.

As you mentioned, all your books hinge on different events. A Little Luck is an accident. Elena Knows, a suicide. In Time of the Flies, it’s murder. They are very psychological—it feels narrowing to pin you down as a crime writer.

My books have layers of different elements. Some readers engage with just one layer. Others engage with several layers. Some might enter a layer that no one else does, but you can enter through different places. For some, the entry point might be the detective aspect, but not for me as a writer.

Your work engages quite a lot with South America’s feminist movements. In Time of the Flies, you explore the word “femicide”—can it be done by a woman to another woman? Or is it just at the hands of a man…? Could you explain your questioning in this book?

I try to address the discussions within the feminist movement. Maybe I don’t have the right answer.

Today, where many countries are shifting to the right, including my own, the term “feminicide” is being questioned. So I think it’s much more important to highlight what “feminicide” is. Some countries have accepted the concept of feminicide, but then a conservative party is elected and starts questioning whether feminicide exists because “men are also killed”.

“I try to address discussions within the feminist movement”

That’s an absolutely ignorant conclusion. Feminicide, or femicide, refers to the killing of a woman simply because she is a woman. So, more men are killed than women each day. Yes, but they are killed in muggings, in various situations. It’s not that they are killed because they are men. In contrast, with women, what we’re addressing is a hatred toward women. It’s a situation where a man, in general, goes and kills a woman.

What the novel tries to do is push this to the extreme. Some women hate other women simply for being that type of woman. But, it’s more of a reflection brought to an extreme level—that there are also women who are sexist, who are patriarchal. But the reality is that murder is committed 99% of the time by a man.

Ethically, it would have been more straightforward if Inés killed her husband, rather than her husband’s lover—but you decided to take a path that’s morally more blurred…

So, twenty years ago I wrote the book, All Yours, where Inés kills her husband’s lover. Inés was a completely patriarchal woman. She would have remained married to that man, even if he had been unfaithful. So, Inés from 20 years ago doesn’t kill Ernesto because, despite everything, she still wants to be Ernesto’s wife.

Now, 20 years later, Inés is in prison. With the [rise of] the feminist movement, I think we all [have changed]—including me, as a writer. I don’t know if I would write Inés now the way I did 20 years ago.

When I wrote Time of the Flies, I already knew that Inés had killed the lover because Inés was an entirely conservative woman. Inés emerges from prison as a different woman. The world has changed radically. She has to change too. She can’t become the best feminist in the world overnight, but gradually, there are things she can adjust to. Her friend Manca helps her make those changes.



A male journalist asked me why Ernesto isn’t in Time of the Flies. And it’s precisely because her evolution involves breaking away from Ernesto. Any friend would tell her, “Enough with Ernesto; don’t let him be a part of your life anymore.”

I hadn’t thought about how the rise of the feminist movement had changed the discussion so much within those twenty years that Inés was in jail…But of course that makes sense.

This novel, instead of discussing issues externally—like we have for so long, fighting for our rights and our place in the world—focuses on internal reflection. That’s why there are different voices of women who, even within the feminist movement, may have differing opinions.

In classical Argentine culture—for example, golden age tangos—many works describe the trope of a “crime of passion”. This is a controversial term as it has been historically and judicially used to justify the murder of women as acts of love. Are you exposing the hypocrisy of that term by focusing on female murderers?

As you say, I try to never use the term “crime of passion” or any similar words, not for a man or a woman. A “crime of passion” implies that it was someone’s fault because there was passion and love. But in reality, what’s happening is something else—it’s murder, it’s hate.

“This novel, instead of discussing issues externally—like we have for so long, fighting for our rights and our place in the world—focuses on internal reflection.”

Of course, tango in Argentina constantly has those kinds of absolutely sexist [elements]. I think there’s a whole education through music, poetry, TV series, and movies which is now being dismantled. But for many years, we were taught by that kind of sentimental education — it’s been a problem for generations.

People writing now have a responsibility— to be aware that we are creating a different kind of sentimental education. This doesn’t mean it’s not literary. One thinks in literary terms, telling a story from a literary perspective. But I’m also aware that someone is reading on the other side. That what we write, in a way, shapes the unconscious and collective mindset of certain generations.

It’s not just what one person writes; all the literature of an era shapes the mindset of that time. And that also comes with a certain responsibility as a writer.

We’ve spoken about the feminist movement. When I read the book I do feel compassion for Inés, that she was bullied, gaslighted and manipulated by Ernesto. Do you write your books in dialogue with social movements, and if so, how is the current right-wing Argentine government of Milei shaping your work?

It’s never that I’m writing about what will happen; I’m always writing about what is happening. As writers, we have—as Antonio Tabucchi says in Autobiografías ajenas—our antennas up, quickly detecting what’s around us. We detect things, put them into words, and invent a story. If that story isn’t real, if it doesn’t exactly match the world, it doesn’t matter because we’re not sociologists, anthropologists, or scholars of social movements.

Often, these stories we invent seem to come before the actual processes, but they were already there, right? My novels are very contemporary. I think Time of the Flies is very contemporary. What’s happening in that novel is happening in different countries.

There’s a regression now in Argentina. We now have an abortion law that was passed last year, but every so often, voices question whether it can be repealed. We had comprehensive sexual education programs in schools but this government is removing them. In the [government’s] advertisements, they show boys dressed in blue and girls dressed in pink, which is something we know, as feminists and educators, are stereotypes. We fight to break them. I don’t know how long we can resist.

The novel I wrote this year has a lot to do with this. I start writing a story, my characters go out into the world. What they encounter is what I encounter too. And it has a lot to do with questioning the things being debated within feminism. In this case, the [new] novel is more about sex work. There are many divisions within feminism on whether it should be allowed, regulated or abolished. I like to dive into those questions that we still don’t have answers to.

Can’t wait to read it! You’ve been busy with a lot of projects—a Netflix adaptation of Elena Knows recently premiered. It was interesting to visually see the city and the journeys Elena has to make to solve the mystery of her daughter’s death. What did you think of it?

It’s a very intense movie, and Buenos Aires is very much present because it’s about the journey of a person with Parkinson’s disease travelling from the outskirts of Buenos Aires into the city. So, while this trip might take 40 minutes for someone else, for her, it’s almost like the journey of The Odyssey.

The physical work that Mercedes Morán, the actress, did to portray this character with Parkinson’s was incredible. Mercedes, who is a friend of mine, never met my mother, who had that disease. When the movie came out, all my family—my children, nieces, nephews, cousins—said, “But did Mercedes meet Cuca?” — Cuca was my mum. Mercedes was identical to her, she did such a fantastic job, and that really moved me a lot.

Speaking of Buenos Aires, your novels are very focused on the city. Your long-time English translator, Frances Riddle, also lives there. Is that something important to you?

I think it’s important. I enjoy having Frances as my translator, not only does she know the city, but she also understands certain aspects of the idiosyncrasies of Argentines. She’s married to an Argentine and has an Argentine son, so even though she’s not from Argentina, she knows us very well. That helps a lot, especially with this novel, because there are many different voices.

I’ve been translated by people who don’t live in Buenos Aires who also do a good job. What happens in those cases is that they ask more questions. Frances has rarely asked me questions about the texts because she doesn’t need to—she already knows the details.

But even if someone hasn’t lived in the country, if they’re a good translator, they’ll find a way to grasp those nuances.

Thank you so much, Claudia!

Time of the Flies, translated by Frances Riddle, is out now with Charco Press.

On Monday morning, journalists and freedom of speech advocates were horrified to discover that an item had been published in the Official Gazette establishing that certain topics were off limits to freedom of information requests.

Argentina’s current Public Information Law was passed in 2017 by then-President Mauricio Macri after the bill had been approved by both chambers of Congress. The decree issued by President Javier Milei changes seven articles of that law. The motive: preventing people from asking the president about the sensitive subject of how many dogs he has. The leader apparently still struggles to accept that his beloved Conan is no longer on this mortal coil, and there have been ambiguities about the fate of his clones, named after economists.

It’s worth remembering that the Treasury Prosecutor had already ruled back in July that Milei’s dogs were off-limits to public enquiry.

Freedom of information advocates were quick to highlight that we can’t laugh this off by reducing it to the president’s canine complex.

The original law assumes that all information created by people, companies and agencies obligated to disclose documents when requested is public — from Congress to trusts set up with partial state funding, the Council of Magistrates to companies in which the state is a stakeholder, everything is considered of public interest and thus falls under the Public Information Law purview.

This week’s decree would change that, with experts agreeing that the most troubling modifications are changes to the definition of what constitutes “public information” and the term “document.”

The government is trying to establish that “private information” generated by “private actors” is now off limits as well as “information that does not compromise the public interest.” However, as the original letter of the law alludes to, citizens have the right to know about non-state actors who are using state resources. Moving away from the premise that their activity is public is concerning when it comes to this government’s interest in transparency.

The other main target was the exact definition of what a “document” is. The 2017 law defined them as all records by those people and entities under the law’s purview. Now, Milei administration contends that’s only valid for information related to “state activity.” They also added that “preliminary deliberations and paperwork, as well as preliminary examinations of an issue, are not considered public documents.”

That wording restricts what we can ask about the process that went into creating major legal documents — the draft of a bill created by private interest groups would usually be subject to public information requests. However, with these modifications, that insight into how certain legislation was made would be gone. This comes just months after we found out that a lot of sections of the president’s flagship Ley Bases had been written by private law firms representing companies with interests in what was being legislated.

As long as they can argue someone is technically from the private sector or certain information doesn’t undermine the public interest, that’s enough to rebuff a request.

There are also questions regarding the actual legality of the move. Per Article 28 of the Argentine Constitution, a presidential decree can establish how a law will be enforced, but cannot change its contents. By restricting the reach of the 2017 law, the decree is violating the original spirit of the law.

Whereas lawmakers in Congress set ample limits to what constituted public information, the government now intends to set boundaries guided by what they say is an interest in protecting government officials’ privacy without ever establishing a clear definition of what that entails.

Poder Ciudadano, a non-profit organization devoted to defending civil rights, stated that “no decree can restrict information access beyond what a democratically sanctioned law by Congress has already established.”

The same goes for stipulating that only “state activity” documents are admissible. A clear restriction of the 2017 writing, that included “all records” independently of when or why they were created, insofar as they were made by people with government responsibilities.

This also seems to imply that there is a clear line marking where said activity begins and ends. This could be a valid point of discussion, except that nowhere does the government offer clear guidelines establishing where that boundary lies, adding unnecessary ambiguity that only muddle things even more.

As it was, freedom of information requests were almost always a game of negotiation and expectation management. A key tool for citizens, it was never a hack giving unlimited access to government information. There are exceptions, waiting times, finaegling and you usually need to have a very good idea of what you’re looking for to word the request just right. Putting more hurdles in the process and restricts the public’s access to the government’s movements — anybody can file a freedom of information request, not just journalists.

As with many policies under this administration, the trigger may be inane and the implementation clumsy, but the consequences are still dire.

La libertad de información, afuera

Es fácil reírse de límites en el acceso a la información pública que parecen diseñados para evitar preguntas incómodas sobre los perros de Milei. Pero se trata de una amenaza real.

El lunes por la mañana, periodistas y militantes por la libertad de expresión descubrieron con horror que se había publicado en el Boletín Oficial un artículo que establecía que ciertos temas se encontraban fuera del alcance de los pedidos de información pública.

La actual Ley de Información Pública de Argentina fue reglamentada en 2017 por el entonces presidente Mauricio Macri después de que el proyecto de ley fuera aprobado por ambas cámaras del Congreso. El decreto del presidente Javier Milei modifica siete artículos de esa ley. El motivo: impedir que la gente le pregunte al presidente sobre el sensible tema de cuántos perros tiene. Al parecer, al líder libertario todavía le cuesta aceptar que su amado Conan ya no está en este mundo, y el destino de sus clones, que tienen nombres de economistas, es un asunto lleno de ambigüedades.

Vale la pena recordar que el Procurador del Tesoro ya había dictaminado en julio que los perros de Milei estaban fuera del alcance de la investigación pública.

Los defensores de la libertad de información rápidamente señalaron que no podemos reírnos de esto reduciéndolo al complejo canino del presidente.

La ley original presupone que toda información creada por personas, empresas y organismos obligados a divulgar documentos cuando se les solicita es pública. Desde el Congreso hasta los fideicomisos creados con financiación estatal parcial, el Consejo de la Magistratura y las empresas en las que el Estado es accionista, todo se considera de interés público y, por lo tanto, cae dentro del ámbito de aplicación de la Ley de Información Pública.

El decreto de esta semana cambiaría eso, y los expertos coinciden en que las modificaciones más preocupantes son los cambios en la definición de lo que constituye “información pública” y el término “documento”.

El gobierno está tratando de establecer que la “información privada” generada por “actores privados” ahora está fuera del alcance, así como la “información que no compromete el interés público”. Sin embargo, la letra original de la ley establece que los ciudadanos tienen derecho a saber sobre los actores no estatales que están utilizando recursos estatales. Alejarse de la premisa de que su actividad es pública es preocupante en lo que respecta al interés de este gobierno en la transparencia.

El otro objetivo principal era la definición exacta de lo que es un “documento”. La ley de 2017 los definía como todos los registros de aquellas personas y entidades bajo el ámbito de aplicación de la ley. Ahora, la administración de Milei sostiene que eso solo es válido para la información relacionada con la “actividad estatal”. También agregó que “las deliberaciones y trámites preliminares, así como los exámenes preliminares de un asunto, no se consideran documentos públicos”.

Esa redacción restringe lo que podemos preguntar sobre el proceso para crear documentos legales importantes: el borrador de un proyecto de ley creado por grupos de interés privados normalmente estaría sujeto a solicitudes de información pública. Sin embargo, con estas modificaciones, esa información sobre cómo se hizo cierta legislación desaparecería. Esto ocurre solo unos meses después de que descubrimos que muchas secciones de la emblemática Ley Bases del presidente habían sido escritas por estudios de abogados privados que representaban a empresas con intereses en lo que se estaba legislando.

Para rechazar una solicitud, entonces, sería suficiente argumentar que alguien es técnicamente del sector privado o que cierta información no socava el interés público.

También hay dudas sobre la legalidad real de la medida. Según el artículo 28 de la Constitución argentina, un decreto presidencial puede establecer cómo se aplicará una ley, pero no puede cambiar su contenido. Al restringir el alcance de la ley de 2017, el decreto viola el espíritu original de la ley.

Mientras que los legisladores del Congreso establecieron amplios límites a lo que constituye información pública, el gobierno ahora pretende establecer límites guiados por lo que, dicen, es un interés en proteger la privacidad de los funcionarios del gobierno, pero sin dar nunca una definición clara de lo que eso implica.

Poder Ciudadano, una organización sin fines de lucro dedicada a la defensa de los derechos civiles, afirmó que “ningún decreto puede restringir el acceso a la información más allá de lo que una ley democráticamente sancionada por el Congreso ya ha establecido”.

Lo mismo ocurre con la estipulación de que solo son admisibles los documentos de “actividad estatal”. Una clara restricción al texto de 2017, que incluía “todos los registros” independientemente de cuándo o por qué fueron creados, en la medida en que fueron hechos por personas con responsabilidades gubernamentales.

Esto también parece implicar que existe una línea clara que marca dónde comienza y dónde termina dicha actividad. Este podría ser un punto válido de discusión, excepto que en ningún lado el gobierno ofrece pautas claras que establezcan dónde está ese límite, lo que agrega una ambigüedad innecesaria que solo complica las cosas aún más.

Hasta ahora, las solicitudes de libertad de información casi siempre eran un juego de negociación y gestión de expectativas. Una herramienta clave para los ciudadanos, pero nunca un truco que diera acceso ilimitado a la información del gobierno. Hay excepciones, tiempos de espera, regateos y, por lo general, es necesario tener una muy buena idea de lo que se busca para redactar la solicitud de la manera correcta. Poner más obstáculos en el proceso restringe el acceso del público a los movimientos del gobierno: cualquiera puede presentar un pedido de información pública, no solo los periodistas.

Construction of Argentina’s CAREM-25 small modular reactor (SMR) has once again been stopped, this time by layoffs of construction workers. Some 153 people were laid off, taking the total number of firings to 470 since the beginning of the year. According to the Buenos Aires Herald, the layoffs were carried out by the three private construction contractors in charge of the project due to lack of sufficient funding from the government.

According to construction union representatives, CAREM’s construction is 85% complete and was set to go online in 2028, before the latest stoppage.

In October 2023, Argentina’s National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA – Comisión Nacional de Energía Atómica) and Nucleoeléctrica Argentina SA (NA-SA) signed a framework agreement for technical assistance to develop CAREM (Central ARgentina de Elementos Modulares) – Argentina’s first domestically-designed and developed 32 MWe nuclear power unit. As well as relying on passive safety systems, CAREM’s entire primary coolant system is contained within the single self-pressurised vessel and uses free convection to circulate the coolant. This eliminates the need for devices such as pumps within the primary circuit and decreases the extent and complexity of the piping system required, as well as reduces the possibility of accidents involving a loss of coolant.

Development started in 1980 by CNEA and technology company INVAP and it was first announced in 1984. Progress slowed in the early 2000s but a 2006 government decree made the CAREM programme a national priority. A second executive order in 2008 made the project directly responsible to the President of Argentina.

Initially, CAREM-25 was expected to start up in 2017, but this was put back to 2020. Then, in 2019 contractor Techint Engineering & Construction stopped work alleging late payment from the government among other delays. In April 2020, it was announced that construction was to resume. In mid-2020, a “transition” contract was signed, allowing he CAREM Works Directorate Management and the Nuclear Project Management Unit of NA-SA to reactivate the project and reinstate workers who had been laid off.

In mid-2021, a contract was signed whereby NA-SA resumed execution of construction, under the direction of CNEA allowing 36 months to complete the reactor building. The Technical Assistance Framework Agreement between CNEA and NA-SA, with a duration of two years, extendable by mutual agreement, provides the general framework to enable contracts related to CAREM. The October 2023 framework agreement led to optimism that the project would finally be completed. At that time, about 1,400 people were working on the project, including CNEA staff and suppliers and there were 160 contracts in force, mostly with Argentine companies.

However, the election of right-wing Javier Milei as President in November 2023 ushered in radical economic reforms including cuts in public spending and social unrest. The CAREM project fell victim to this and the 2028 launch date is now looking uncertain. In addition to the layoffs, CNEA recently announced that it had decided to put the building stage on hold and focus on an “engineering revision stage”.

CNEA president Germán Guido Lavalle said that construction is “essentially finished” and remaining details “will be completed over the next few years”. The release added that the project will need new funds in the future and that CNEA will continue to work alongside the government with a focus on engineering instead of construction.

“Works for the modular nuclear reactor CAREM are in place and have not stopped,” a CNEA communiqué stated. “The project is in an advanced building stage and contracts related to those tasks are coming to an end,” they added, referring to the layoffs.

However, CNEA was not assigned a budget for this year and has been using an extension of the 2023 one. In March, the government renewed all state employee contracts for only three months. At that time, CNEA managers called the situation “critical” in an internal document, warning that the budget could last only until May or June.

“We were expecting this. We knew the budget for this year would not be enough to continue with the project,” said Adriana Serquis, former head of the CNEA who left her post in May due to ideological differences with the Milei administration. She is now the director of CNEA’s Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute.

“The lack of funding led to part of the construction stage being halted, and it all comes down to a budget issue,” Serquis said. “Even if [CNEA] says the project will continue, it will be very slow. During that time, they won’t be able to guarantee that qualified staff will stay and achieve the goal of being one of the first countries to have this kind of reactor.”

The decision to lay off experienced workers also affects development of Argentina’s nuclear industry overall. According to Julio González, a construction union leader in Zárate, where the reactor is being built, there are only 160 builders still in position and this will be reduced to 30 by November. “They have acquired knowledge in building nuclear reactors,” González told the Buenos Aires Herald. “Halting the project means older workers who are close to retirement age will not be able to transfer their knowledge to newer generations.”

For Serquis, the situation regarding the loss of professionals is serious. “We are now scared that engineering teams will fall apart. It’s very hard to put them back together,” she warned. “It’s a mixture of sadness, anger, and helplessness.”

Argentina’s Tres Lineas said “the dismantling of nuclear policy is progressing rapidly. Workers from several different unions such as Uecara and Uocra, ATE and Luz y Fuerza, protested by blocking National Route 9. ATE said the excuse being given is engineering problems when they understand that in reality the problem is “the brutal adjustment that the Milei government is making which is being carried out by the authorities of the National Atomic Energy Commission”.",Argentina’s CAREM-25 SMR faces setbacks,"The CAREM-25 SMR construction site in August 2024 (Source: CNEA)Construction of Argentina’s CAREM-25 small modular reactor (SMR) has once again been stopped, this time by layoffs of construction workers.

In a perfect match, these brands, particularly those specializing in hair products, are gaining customers in those Arab.

During a tour conducted by ANBA at Beauty Fair, the largest beauty fair in the Americas held earlier this month in São Paulo, it was possible to find among the exhibitors both long-time suppliers to the Arab market and those aiming to enter it. All are confident that the Arab region offers a fertile ground for the cosmetics made here.

Jane Sarrasi created a formaldehyde-free progressive hair straightening product

Present in the national market for 13 years and an exhibitor at the fair, Floractive Profissional is one of the Brazilian cosmetic companies that has already established itself in the Arab market. The company exports its hair treatment products to over 70 countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Lebanon, Tunisia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco, and Egypt.

“It was a financial necessity that led me to start reselling products to hairdressers. After a while, I noticed a gap in the market. I saw that there were no organic, formaldehyde-free products for hair straightening, so, with the help of my husband, I created W One, a formaldehyde-free hair straightening product. Now, 13 years later, Floractive has over 200 products for sale and exports to various countries,” says Jane Sarrasi, CEO of Floractive Profissional.

Their first sale to an Arab country happened without any grand expectations. A distributor of the brand was promoting Floractive’s products on social media when she was contacted by a hairdresser from Egypt in 2014. “This buyer received our product and decided to test it alongside other brands of similar products. After testing all of them, she liked ours the most and began purchasing,” Sarrasi recalls.

Then, after getting halal-certified, the Brazilian company expanded to other Arab countries. “I have a special fondness for our Arab partners who are more than just clients—they’ve become friends. They’re part of an ancient culture that teaches us a lot about business. I love being able to provide solutions that make a difference in the market, not only for the hairdresser but also for the investor,” she says.

In addition to products for hair straightening, Arab buyers often purchase shampoos and post-treatment masks. “Very well received, our products deliver very good results for Arab women. They don’t actually have curly hair, but it tends to be more voluminous and usually drier due to the use of the hijab,” says Sarrasi.

With her own manufacturing facility located in São Paulo state, the businesswoman not only exports her brand’s products but also manufactures products for other brands. Lebanon, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Australia are among the destinations that order productions from Sarrasi.

“Some clients come to me and request a reformulation of their products. Our professionals create the formulations, they approve them, and then we produce. There are products that we develop together. Generally, Arabs do not request native ingredients for their products—they only care that the raw materials are ideal for that type of production.”

Present in all Brazilian states in a more subtle way, with small distributors, the Brazilian brand is now focusing its efforts on conquering more international territories. With that in mind, Floractive participated as an exhibitor at Beauty Fair 2024. Over the four-days event, the CEO got to speak with potential new buyers from Chile, Argentina, and Paraguay.

Light Hair: Seeking halal certification

Juliana Lemos founded Light Hair in 2010

Aiming to enter the Arab market, Light Hair Professional also exhibited at the largest beauty event in the Americas. Founded in 2010, this Brazilian hair treatment brand is seeking to build connections with Arab buyers.

“I have a degree in Marketing, and I’ve just completed a course from ApexBrasil [Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency] that taught me about the legislation in the UAE, for example. Now, I’m going to get halal-certified, translate my product labels into English and Spanish, and learn more about the Arab and Latin American markets,” said Juliana Lemos, CEO of Light Hair Professional.

Lemos still isn’t quite sure how to find Arab buyers, so she is looking for partners who can help her find the best path. Due to the region’s proximity and trade benefits, the brand will first try to connect with Mercosur buyers in the coming months.

Light Hair: Hair-focused products

Like Sarrasi, Lemos were also reselling hair products from other brands before deciding to start her own company. “While working as a saleswoman, I always had trouble finding 2.5-kg products, which were used in salon sinks, to resell. With that in mind, I created my first line of 2.5-kg shampoo and conditioner for hairdressers. In 14 years, my company has grown so much that we now have our own factory,” says the CEO of Light Hair Professional.

Present in almost all Brazilian states, the company used Beauty Fair to connect with new buyers. In addition to selling its own brand’s hair treatment, chemical and finishing products, Light Hair Professional also manufactures hair products for the Pão de Açúcar brand.

Terra Fértil: Hair straighteners and dryers

Terra Fértil Beauty Group, which also exhibited at Beauty Fair, shared a bit about its commercial history with the Arabs. With a background in hair chemistry, Sérgio Caltabiano, CEO of the company, taught at Anhembi Morumbi University before starting his business.

Caltabiano used his engineering skills to develop products

“In 2005, when the Brazilian market started paying attention to hair, so did I. After listening to professional needs, I decided to use my engineering skills to develop a high-performance lightweight hair straightener.”

After the first creation succeeded and gained popularity, Caltabiano decided to develop a unique hair dryer that was lightweight and comfortable. As the brand grew and sold to the domestic market, the CEO attended international trade shows to promote the products to overseas buyers.

At a trade show in Dubai, UAE, in 2016, the Brazilian first made contact with Arab buyers. Over the next eight years, the Brazilian has exported hair straighteners and dryers to buyers in Lebanon, Egypt, and the UAE.

“The distinctive features that make them buy my straightener are its added value of innovation, its lightweight design, which provides greater comfort for those using it for many hours, and its ability to prevent burning while adding shine to the hair,” said Caltabiano.

Terra Fértil Beauty Group’s hair straightener

The CEO of Terra Fértil Beauty Group explains that, like Brazilian women, Arab women also tend to take frequent care of their hair, which is why they visit hair salons for blowouts and straightening. “As their hair is thicker and longer, they go often to take care of it, not just for special occasions, but in their daily routine.”

In addition to hair straighteners and dryers, Terra Fértil Beauty Group also sells on its website brush sanitizers, accessories including various types of hairbrushes, and furniture used in hair salons and barbershops.

Rich Haythornthwaite, who has recently taken up the role of Chairman of Britain’s major bank NatWest, still partially owned by the UK government, was paid a million ringgit a year (“$500k gross £200k net”) backdated to 2008 according to a contract drawn up in 2010, after the 1MDB joint venture had poured an initial $300 million into the fledgling oil company.

A ‘final contract‘, that matched several versions in the PetroSaudi database, further included two retention payments to be paid in due course totalling $2 million (c RM8 million at the time).

Haythornthwaite worked for the company for eight years thereby potentially earning some 16 million ringgit, although he has subsequently denied that the bonus payments (apparently structured to avoid British tax) were actually made.

Key Company Player

As Chief Operating Officer, President and the stated Number three in the PetroSaudi International organisation chart, Rick Haythornthwaite played a key part in developing the company’s business.

The parent company was established in 2005 (according to its current website) in Saudi Arabia but had no operating business before PetroSaudi International (UK) was incorporated in 2009.

Mr Haythornthwaite himself stated in an email sent to director Patrick Mahony in 2010 that he saw his role at PetroSaudi International as:

“Leading the development and success of our business operations, ranging from strategy formulation to deep tactical involvement (whatever it takes to move the business forward), including the development of organisational structure, systems and culture; Supporting Patrick Mahony in the new business development and expansion; Using my extensive business networks to source opportunities and facilitate business delivery; Leveraging my City and international reputation should we wish to access the public equity or debt markets; The attraction and recruitment of talent. Helping in every possible way to protect and enhance the PetroSaudi brand.”

Correspondence and documentation also shows that Haythornthwaite was a driving force in the negotiations beginning in June 2009 to acquire a time limited option to enter a so-called Farm-in agreement with the Canadian company Buried Hill, which owned a potentially valuable oil concession in the Caspian Sea gained from Turkmenistan.

The negotiations were financed by a loan from the venture capital company Ashmore, where the now convicted Patrick Mahony was working at the same time as fulfilling the role of Chief Investment Officer at PetroSaudi.

The Caspian Oil Field Fraud

The project was fatally flawed, however, in that it was widely known that the Serdar oil concession belonging to Buried Hill lies in disputed territory. It has yet to be exploited.

A letter of agreement drawn up and sent to PetroSaudi colleagues by Rick Haythornthwaite in 2009 recognised the problem saying

“It is acknowledged by the Parties that the Boundary Dispute could, despite all reasonable endeavours … give rise to circumstances in which the Parties’ ability to conduct Petroleum Operations under or relating to or arising from the Contract is compromised.“

Nonetheless, it was this option that was used by Patrick Mahony to obtain the $2.9 billion valuation of PetroSaudi’s assets that was presented to 1MDB as the basis for the joint venture into which the Malaysian fund invested $1 billion in cash.

The billion dollar cash ‘investment’ was publicly announced in the Malaysian media at the time, and prime minister Najib Razak openly referred to PetroSaudi as having also contributed $1.5 billion – later briefed to newsmen as being in the form of its assets in the Caspian Sea.

PetroSaudi’s law firm White & Case drew up organisation charts in the week before the announcement of the joint venture deal that featured the Turkmenistan ‘holding company’ as the key $1.5bn asset brought by PetroSaudi into the JV (along with an Argentine venture that soon folded).

Yet PetroSaudi never owned the asset behind that valuation. It merely had an option to buy a 50% share of the Buried Hill venture under terms that would have required PetroSaudi to then fund the hundreds of millions required to begin operations.

Those terms were made clear in the negotiated agreement drawn up by Rick Haythornthwaite which Sarawak Report has sighted.

Rick Haythornthwaite has denied that he had sight of the separate joint venture negotiations with 1MDB or that he was privy to the false claims of ownership being made by PetroSaudi.

Sarawak Report does not contest that denial. However, as the correspondence makes clear, Haythornthwaite was aware the Turkmenistan option was cancelled immediately after the Joint Venture was signed, meaning Malaysia had invested in a company with no active operations.

Indeed, the decision to cancel the contract was communicated to Ashmore by Patrick Mahony and PetroSaudi’s lawyer the day after the 1MDB payment of $300 million to PetroSaudi was banked on 1st October 2009.

Well Run Small British Oil Company?

This week the NatWest Chair’s press relations representative assured Sarawak Report “Rick remains appalled by the criminal actions of directors at the PetroSaudi parent company. He also regrets being initially dismissive of the Sarawak Report’s inquiries….. Misconduct at the parent company level was not visible to Rick or to others at PetroSaudi UK. Indeed, it was actively covered up.”

The statement continued:

“It is important not to mischaracterize the nature and work of PetroSaudi UK, which was a legitimate, well-run small oil company. It had, at various times, exploration and development projects in Turkmenistan, West Africa, Venezuela and Indonesia. It had compulsory compliance reporting and good staff. Rick helped to build this legitimate business, providing an advisory service in good faith.”

Sarawak Report has questioned the rigour of such compliance, which failed to detect the fundamental deceit in the way PetroSaudi International was presented to 1MDB during the joint venture negotiations conducted in London through the lawfirm White & Case.

It was the money defrauded from 1MDB that funded the entirety of PetroSaudi’s future operations, including Rick Haythornthwaite’s backdated contract with PetroSaudi International (UK).

Or Rag Bag Operation?

Despite to the above statement, Rick Haythornthwaite had described PetroSaudi very differently in December 2009, when he called it a rag bag of part timers rather than a well run company with a strong staff.

In an email to Patrick Mahony citing an ‘Organisation Chart’ he’d created to promote PetroSaudi to the Venezuelan government he said it “shows ‘how we are developing’ rather than a rag bag of part timers. Try it on for size.”

In a further email sent to Mahony in 2010, Haythornthwaite referred to his “work with PetroSaudi in uncertain circumstances as an act of good faith …. recognising that the longer term structure still remains uncertain.”

In fact, PetroSaudi had no active operations in Turkmenistan, Africa or Indonesia, and the Venezuela drill ship operation was funded with stolen 1MDB money.

Neither were there full time staff before 1MDB paid hundreds of millions in cash (now frozen) on which no returns were ever made.

This suggests a level of poor compliance and poor due diligence on the part of the senior, if part-time, staff of the British based company and the man who is now in charge of a major public bank.

No Questions Over The Missing $700?

This site has also approached Rick Haythornthwaite over his apparent failure to question the missing $700 million from the original $1 billion that was publicly announced by 1MDB as having been invested in the joint venture, given PetroSaudi itself only received $300 million.

As the above step chart shows, White & Case were instructed just days in advance of the joint venture to execute a fictional $700 million loan from a Cayman Island subsidiary of PetroSaudi to the new 1MDB PetroSaudi (BVI) subsidiary – even before a company bank account had been created to receive it (see the DOJ civil asset seizure suit).

1MDB’s management agreed days later to purchase 40% of 1MDB PetroSaudi (BVI) with the billion dollar payment on the understanding that $700 million of that cash would be used to ‘repay’ the non-existent loan.

When he learnt what had happened the Chairman of the board of 1MDB very publicly resigned. All this was public from July 2015.

The loan device was later spun as having been executed in recognition of the superior value of the assets injected by PetroSaudi into the JV.

However, not only did those assets did not exist but the $700 million did not go back to PetroSaudi but rather to a Seychelles company called Good Star Limited which belonged to Najib Razor’s proxy, Jho Low.

Sarawak Report exposed this theft in February 2015 and by March no less than four Malaysian task forces had been set up to investigate.

Quite apart from the growing chorus from early 2015, PetroSaudi operatives could hardly have failed to notice that since the very inception of the joint venture in 2009 there had been persistent concerns raised in Malaysia about 1MDB’s missing money from this joint venture.

The fund had changed auditors three times amidst inordinate delays in producing audits, the Chairman of 1MDB and board members had resigned, the fund was billions of dollars in debt and its supposed profits had been secreted into a Cayman Islands vehicle named Brazen Sky, that was opaquely concealing its financial situation behind a non-market based self valuation of its own ‘units’.

Yet, 1MDB and the director of PetroSaudi, Tarek Obaid, continued to confirm in 2015 that Good Star Limited was a subsidiary of PetroSaudi, thereby implying that the 2009 loan had been indeed received by the company as part of the valuation negotiations around the joint venture.

When Sarawak Report requested if Mr Haythornthwaite could confirm this claim, instead of doing so he accused this site of “questionable activities” in raising concerns about the venture and said that even if he could help in our enquiries he would not do so.

We therefore question whether his above claims of strong compliance and indeed due diligence amount to the level expected of the head of one of Britain’s most respected banking institutions?

We also question the claim that he was merely working for the British based arm of PetroSaudi International. In fact, all the proposed ventures set up under his management, including the one operational venture in Venezuela using money stolen from 1MDB, were conducted through a web of off-shore companies controlled not by PetroSaudi International (UK) but by the Cayman parent company.

In an email discussing his proposed delayed ‘retention fees’ of $2 million Haythornthwaite again suggested off-shore instruments to hold the money and even appeared to suggest PetroSaudi might choose to send him to work abroad at the time these were due for payment.

This Coutts Bank (a key subsidiary now of NatWest) ‘bond wrapper’ device would give the appearance of being a method of avoiding tax. In a reply to the Guardian Mr Haythornthwaite has said the proposal “would not have been considered appropriate” and denied it was put into practice. He doesn’t remember having suggested it.

Earlier this week Sarawak Report asked the top businessman whether, given these apparent failings and the now proven criminality of the company he played such a key role in presenting as a respectable brand, would he now offer to return those earnings to Malaysia?

After he failed to reply Sarawak Report made enquiries and received a confirmation that the 1MDB asset recovery taskforce is seeking information leading towards a potential suit against Mr Haythornthwaite.

Mr Haythornthwaite has also failed to respond to our question whether he will make a formal apology to Xavier Justo, a former colleague and PetroSaudi director, whom he failed to support after PetroSaudi International colluded in imprisoning him in Bangkok in an attempt to silence his whistleblowing over the 1MDB fraud?

I regard PetroSaudi as my primary commitment

The Financial Times last week reported that Rick Haythornthwaite had explained, when questioned by NatWest, that his connection to PetroSaudi (now erased from his CV) was minimal during the 8 years of his lucrative employment:

“Haythornthwaite told NatWest he worked as a part-time adviser for a UK subsidiary of PetroSaudi for just one to three hours a week between 2008 and 2016, according to people familiar with the discussions.”

This would indeed have rendered his fees to have been astronomical.

However, new documents have since emerged with would appear to confirm otherwise. They include a letter from Mr Haythornthwaite to the now convicted Patrick Mahony, sent in March 2010, in which he gives a very different description of his job and the hours worked in the course of demanding a formal contract from the now wealthy company thanks to the funds from 1MDB:

“At present, I am receiving $500,000 pa gross (ca £200,000 net) for a commitment of two days a week with the potential for a bonus payable over and above this base amount, at the discretion of the ‘the Board’…… I regard PetroSaudi as my primary commitment and have endeavoured to be available whenever the role dictates – as a result, I have spent considerably more that 2 days per week on PSI business and would expect to so do in future…. I have enjoyed and been happy to work with PetroSaudi in uncertain circumstances as an act of good faith and that good faith has been reciprocated. The time has arrived when we both feel that a more appropriate package should be established, recognising that the longer term structure still remains uncertain. This gives me the opportunity to request a package that reflects my personal objectives and circumstances. My hope is that is works for both of us. Its realisation would, from my perspective, elicit a bond of loyalty, energy and commitment that promises to go well beyond a simple employer-employee relationship… The proposed components are as follows: I will make an average of between 2.5 and 3 days per week available to PetroSaudi, distributed to accommodate the needs of my other roles. This will include a pre-defined 60 days a year when I am available to travel on PetroSaudi business – my 2010 and 2011 diaries have already identified these days. As hitherto, I will always try to accommodate travel request that sit outside theses pre-defined days….”

The letter then goes on to outline the requested terms of the payment contract which was drawn up as described above.",Malaysia Investigating 1MDB Cash Paid To Head Of UK’s NatWest Bank,"Those terms were made clear in the negotiated agreement drawn up by Rick Haythornthwaite which Sarawak Report has sighted.
This week the NatWest Chair’s press relations representative assured Sarawak Report “Rick remains appalled by the criminal actions of directors at the PetroSaudi parent company.

THE PRESIDENT OF PERONISM

Archbishop Héctor Agüer Emeritus of La Plata Buenos Aires, September 25, 2024





Pope Francis has repeatedly announced that his intention is to visit Argentina; but he will not do so: he knows that he would not do very well here. So, now, he descends to the dirty field of political debates with an unusual speech, of fury, against the libertarian government of President Milei. He never made the slightest allusion to Cristina Kirchner's governments, which plunged the country into poverty and destitution. Neither did he react to the worst government in history: that of the useless and abusive Alberto Fernandez, the hypocrite who boasted of being a feminist and beat his wife. The main source of Francis' speech has been, as other times, the news reached by his friend Juan Grabois.





The papal intervention has messed with history: he has repudiated the work of General Julio Argentino Roca, to whom he attributed the slaughter of indigenous people in his Expedition to the Desert; what he has not mentioned are the massacres and the attacks of indigenous people, who arrived almost at the gates of Buenos Aires, and kidnapped women, sowing terror. I am not a Roca fan, but we must recognize that, without that double Presidency of Julio Argentino Roca, Argentina would not exist and Patagonia would be Chilean. What the Pope should have criticized was the religious policy of the Freemason Roca, who kept the country disconnected from the Holy See for 16 years.





The papal critique of the Argentine government is harsh on the anti-picketing protocol; that is, he sides with the piqueteros, who are making people fed up by blocking avenues and causing innumerable inconveniences. “They purchase pepper spray instead of social justice,” he said in an act together with Grabois, and vindicated ‘the struggle’ of the social movements. He also mentioned a case of bribes, but did not specify which administration. The journalist Luciano Román described the papal speech as “an excessively earthy message, which could even be interpreted as far from some balances, complexities, and nuances that usually characterize the words of great religious leaders and other similar ones.” It was based on biased and partial information; it overlooked the complex implications for the common citizen of a sort of anarchy in the streets, and encouraged “the struggle” of social movements. It makes a drama of the use of pepper spray by the security forces, without alluding to the provocations and outrages suffered by institutions such as the national Congress, with stone-throwing attacks, nor to the injuries caused by activists to humble civil servants, such as policemen or gendarmes. Nor did it take into account the burning of public property, and even the destruction of vehicles and businesses in some violent protests.





It is evident that the closeness of the Pontiff with Grabois is not simply a personal bond, but a relationship nourished by coincidences. The Pope's politicization in endorsing social organizations does not call for transparency and respect for the law. He deliberately overlooks the investigations and denunciations that showed how numerous piquetero leaders took advantage of the administration of social plans for their own benefit. The Pope's words against the government will surely be used by these “managers of poverty” as a sort of justification and endorsement.





What Argentine Catholics need is for Francis to act as Pope, to take care of the Catholic religion, and to guide the faithful to grow in the Faith, not to get into the confusing territory of political discussion. “Buy social justice instead of pepper spray”: this this disturbing comment is quite peculiar, when he has not said a word about the situation in Venezuela, where a dictatorship persecuting the opposition rules, and social justice is non-existent. The pepper spray issue was stirred up because of a little girl who suffered the effects, because she participated in an encampment led by her mother, an irresponsible militant.





The Pope, with his speech against the government, exposes himself to the criticisms that are reasonably emerging. The head of the “Federal Innovation” block of Deputies, Miguel Ángel Pichetto, dismissed the Pope's criticisms, stating that “the agenda proposed from the Vatican is absurd and does incredible damage to Argentina.” This national deputy observed that “before, the pontifical manifestations were more of a pastoral nature, never directly addressed to local politics; now, then, there is a new fact. The Pope cannot make this type of manifestations, without his word becoming more fragile”





Francis' intervention against the Argentine government is a new expression of papal progressivism; always moving forward, as it happens with Peronism and its never achieved search for social justice. The Pope contraposes social justice and pepper spray: to repress the picket line, to prevent continuous protest and revolt would be to contradict the dynamism of the Gospel, which must always be reread. Thus, the Second Vatican Council would be a rereading of the Gospel according to the culture of modernity.





Therein lies the progressivism and Peronism that reign in Rome today. Francis is the president of Peronism, as we have already explained on other occasions.","[Catholic Caucus] Francis, the Peronist President of Argentina: What Catholics need is for Francis to act as Pope, not as politician","The main source of Francis' speech has been, as other times, the news reached by his friend Juan Grabois.

The demonstration was organized by the Cuban Degrees Recognition Movement in Spain, with support from the Association of Cuban Doctors in Spain, marking their second protest of this kind.

The demonstrators were received by members of the Popular Party (PP) in the European Parliament. Pedro Navarro, spokesperson for the Ministry of Universities in Congress, stated that they've requested another appearance from Minister Diana Morant to address the delays, particularly affecting Cuban and Venezuelan professionals. Navarro highlighted that Argentine citizens experience a faster recognition process, suggesting that diplomatic pressures might be influencing the situation for Cuban professionals.

Voices from the Protest

Elvira Velazco, vice president of the PP's Health Commission, described the situation as unbearable and vowed to continue presenting parliamentary initiatives to tackle this issue. Pedro Almiral Carbonel, a doctor who graduated in 1999, has been in Spain for two years and is currently unemployed. Yesalin Quiroz Méndez, who arrived two and a half years ago, has had to work as a waitress while waiting for her credentials to be recognized. Luis Enrique Vega Hernández, another protest participant, voiced his frustration about having to work in jobs for which he is overqualified.

A Broader Context of Discrimination

The protest aims not only to highlight the severe discrimination faced by Cuban and Venezuelan professionals but also to denounce the ""arbitrary paralysis"" of recognition processes over the past year. This issue has led to increasing pressure on the Spanish government to expedite these procedures, especially following a recent call from Fátima Matute, the Health Counselor for the Community of Madrid, urging relevant ministries to act more swiftly.

This ongoing problem affects thousands of professionals trained in Cuba and other countries, resulting in various mobilizations in the past. Last April, doctors from different countries residing in Spain protested, deeming it ""unacceptable to prolong the suffering of Cuban doctors fleeing a dictatorship."" Ponce Morales, who has been practicing in Spain for 27 years, emphasized that this issue impacts all doctors struggling with credential recognition, with some processes taking up to seven years, forcing professionals to work in unrelated jobs despite a shortage of medical staff that affects nearly 500,000 patients in Spain.

Calls for Legal Rights and Economic Impact

Dariel Llanes, a member of the Cuban Degrees Recognition Movement in Spain, stressed that the protest is not against the host country but for a legitimate right enshrined in law. He criticized the halt in recognizing Cuban credentials in Spain. Although the law stipulates a maximum six-month period for recognition, the average wait time is around two years. During this period, doctors must make a living by working in cafes, restaurants, and other non-related jobs.

Iranian pediatrician Rami Ahmadi, president of the Just Recognition Now movement, highlighted that the delay in resolving more than 100,000 applications significantly impacts the Spanish economy, especially given the post-pandemic healthcare crisis.",Cuban Doctors Speak Out in Spain: Protest Delays in Credential Recognition,"Over 150 Cuban doctors gathered outside the Spanish Congress in Madrid, demanding answers about the prolonged delays in recognizing their university degrees.

According to a document seen by The Associated Press, prosecutors sought a federal judge to summon those who served during that period as vicar or regional councilor of Opus Dei Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia to testify: Carlos Nannei (1991-1997), Patricio Olmos (1998-2014) and Víctor Urtizarrazu (2014-2022). They also seek to interrogate the regional secretary in charge of the order's female section, Gabriel Dondo, who held the position until 2015.

Opus Dei — Work of God in Latin — was founded by the Spanish priest Josemaría Escrivá in 1928, and has 90,000 members in 70 countries. The lay group, which was greatly favored by St. John Paul II, who canonized Escrivá in 2002, has a unique status in the church and reports directly to the pope. Most members are laymen and women with secular jobs and families who strive to “sanctify ordinary life.” Other members are priests or celibate lay people.

Following a complaint filed in 2022, the team of prosecutors launched an investigation that concluded that from the early 1970s until 2015, “people holding different positions within Opus Dei established a structure dedicated to recruiting at least 44 women, most of them girls and adolescents, to be subjected to living conditions comparable to servitude.""

The Opus Dei in Argentina has denied the accusations.

“We categorically deny the accusations of human trafficking and labor exploitation,” said the office of the Prelature of Opus Dei in Argentina in a statement, adding that in order to build this accusation, ""the formation received by some of the women in the group and the vocation freely chosen by the numerary assistants of Opus Dei are completely taken out of context. This is a totally false accusation.”

Prosecutors argue that Opus Dei selected girls and adolescents from low-income families, usually from rural areas far from the organization’s activity centers, and that they were recruited “under the promise of receiving training and improving their job prospects.”

“Once admitted, they were subjected to a regime of ‘spiritual, professional and work training,’ and if they showed a vocation to be numerary assistants, they were assigned for life to perform domestic tasks in Opus Dei centers, both in the country and abroad,” they said.

The investigation centers on four cases that fit the crime of human trafficking under current Argentinian legislation.

Some of the complainants gave their testimony to AP in a story published in November 2021 in which they reported working under “manifestly illegal conditions” that included working without pay for 12 hours-plus without breaks except for food or prayer, no registration in the Social Security system and other violations of basic rights.

Their identities have been preserved in the prosecutors’ resolution.

Most of the women requested dispensation saying that the physical and psychological demands they were subjected to during their years of service became intolerable.

Qualia Senolytic: Have you heard about senolytics yet? It's a class of ingredients discovered less than 10 years ago, and it's being called the biggest discovery of our time for promoting healthy aging and enhancing your physical prime. Your goals in your career and beyond require productivity. But let's be honest: The aging process is not our friend when it comes to endless energy and productivity. As we age, everyone accumulates ""senescent"" cells in their body. Senescent cells cause symptoms of aging, such as aches and discomfort, slow workout recoveries, and sluggish mental and physical energy associated with that ""middle age"" feeling. Also known as ""Zombie Cells,"" they are old and worn out and not serving a useful function for our health anymore, but they are taking up space and nutrients from our healthy cells. Much like pruning the yellowing and dead leaves off a plant, Qualia Senolytic removes those worn-out senescent cells to allow for the rest of your cells to thrive in the body. Take it just two days a month. The formula is non-GMO, vegan, and gluten-free, and the ingredients are meant to complement one another, factoring in the combined effect of all ingredients together. Resist aging at the cellular level and try Qualia Senolytic. Go to Qualialife.com/ROUNDTABLE for up to 50 percent off and use code ROUNDTABLE at checkout for an additional 15 percent off.

In an apparent communications upset, the government announced that Argentina’s mint would be shut down before quickly backtracking and providing no further information. Presidential Spokesman Manuel Adorni caused a media uproar on Tuesday with a since-deleted post on X: “It has been decided that the mint will be closed. The end.”

There has been no official announcement or disambiguation since that post.

There was already speculation that the mint could be shut down when it appeared in a list of companies destined for the chopping block with President Javier Milei’s original Bases Law. Rumors intensified when at the end of September, the Argentine Central Bank selected the Chinese state-owned mint to print the AR$20,000 bills in a private bidding process. The Argentine mint was not included as a bidder.

Argentina’s mint is a state-owned company called Casa de la Moneda which depends on the Economy Ministry, which told the Herald it was not responsible for the rumors about the alleged closure plans.

The Buenos Aires Graphic Federation, the union representing workers for the mint, said in a communiqué last week that there was an ongoing “hollowing out process.”

“Unfortunately, the state company is semi-paralyzed and isn’t fulfilling its basic objectives for which it was created almost a century and a half ago,” said the statement. It also claimed that three bids by the Central Bank to print banknotes had specifically excluded Argentina’s mint.

On August 23, the Central Bank started a private bid which closed on September 26. The Chinese state-owned China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, which manufactures all renminbi coins and banknotes, offered to do the job for US$11.5 million for 240,000 bills to be used from March to April and US$14.7 million for other 300,000 between May and July. The total cost will be US$26.2 million.

The other four bidders did not present offers for the first tranche of the job and their offers for the second ranged from US$16.9 million to US$25.2 million.

The Brazilian mint, the state-owned Casa da Moeda do Brasil also bid. The others were the French Oberthur Fiduciaire SAS, the Maltese Crane Currency Malta Limited, and the British De la Rue International Limited.

The Central Bank snubbed the Casa de la Moneda because it looked for the best price and it is not obliged to hire the state-owned company, the Herald could learn. Two sources close to the matter said the mint has debts with suppliers and therefore cannot work properly. In 2023, the mint had a AR$422.8 billion deficit: 70% of that debt was allegedly due to investing in new machinery, including a new production line.

Argentina’s mint not only prints banknotes and mints coins. It also prints passports, cigarette tags, university degrees, and others. Should the government bar it from printing new banknoted, it would not necessarily mean that the state-owned company would shut down completely.

UPCN, a union grouping state workers, released a communiqué on Wednesday saying that the Casa de la Moneda president told them that his state-owned company would not shut down, and that it would “continue to work in searching customers and reducing the organism’s debts.”","Argentine mint’s future in doubt after government announces closure, backtracks","Rumors intensified when at the end of September, the Argentine Central Bank selected the Chinese state-owned mint to print the AR$20,000 bills in a private bidding process.

Never one to shy away from a challenge, the South American champion has also squared off against former and future world champions, including Subriel Matias, and even pulled off a surprise victory over Cesar Cuenca. Eniz will be aiming for his fifth career win over an undefeated fighter when he meets Biyarslanov in the ring.

On September 27, 2024 was held in Vienna – Austria the Festival of Long Nights of Interculturality 2024, where Paraguayan indigenous culture was introduced among the participation of forty other countries.

Austria’s strategic location in the heart of Europe gives it a unique role as a hub of convergence of cultures. Vienna, in particular, with its vibrant history and artistic richness, has evolved as a living showcase of cultural diversity. The “Long Night of Interculturality” festival, sponsored by the Austrian Commission for UNESCO, celebrates precisely that diversity, emphasizing the value of inclusion and mutual respect between nations.

Vienna has become the musical capital of the world and Paraguay revealed its cultural richness and wealth of indigenous ethnography.

According to Pedro Escobar Medina, a distinguished journalist from Asuncion: “This prestigious festival, which brings together over 40 countries from around the world, offers a unique space where recent migrants from all continents can showcase their traditional garments in one place, fostering cultural exchange. On Friday, September 27, the opening ceremony of the event with the “Costumes of the World” parade took place in the Festsaal (Act Hall) of the Vienna City Hall (Wiener Rathaus in German), a majestic building located in the first district that is the center of the capital of Austria.

In an event that highlighted the richness and cultural diversity of the five continents, Paraguay left an indelible mark on its first participation in the “Long Intercultural Nights 2024”. A group of 17 compatriots, dressed in typical traditional costumes of their country, represented Paraguay with pride and dignity, integrating into the multicultural atmosphere of Vienna, the world’s music capital.

The festival “Long Nights of Interculturality 2024” was organized by the International Organization for Cultural Diversity (ICDO) and is considered the largest cultural event in Vienna, held annually for a week in September. In addition to parades, the event offers music, art, round tables, cinema and gastronomy, all in an environment that celebrates diversity and promotes interculturality.

Among the Paraguayan representation stands out the special participation of the leader and shaman Ishir Ybytoso, Bruno Barras, who traveled from Paraguay to join the celebration. Their presence was a living testimony to Paraguay’s ancestral traditions and their commitment to preserving Ishir Culture. Barras brought a spiritual and authentic touch to national representation, connecting the present with the country’s historical roots. Barras delivered a necklace made of seeds in his native Carcha Balut, a plumeric art necklace, a small handicraft folder in ñanduti in a picture to Josipa Palace president of the organization (ICDO). Paraguayan gastronomy wasn’t missing either, the chiperitas served to the public our popular Paraguayan chipa who delighted with pleasure. Paraguay was represented not only by the original peoples, the typical clothing, the crafts but also the gastronomy.

The participation of Paraguay in this event would not have been possible without the dedication and coordination of Isabel Arevalos, Paraguayan cultural manager based in Austria, who, together with a group of compatriots residing in the Alpine country, made all efforts to ensure that Paraguay was represented at this international event. Their work has been instrumental in opening doors to future cultural collaborations, and Paraguay’s participation in the 2025 edition is already glimpsed with enthusiasm, aiming to continue positioning the country on the global stage in the cultural realm.

Vienna, cradle of Cultures

The main objective of this event was to promote cultural expressions from different parts of the world in an environment of respect and cooperation, highlighting their contemporary value and encouraging genuine exchange among communities. Through varied activities such as music, art, film and gastronomy, the festival seeks to bring people together and emphasize the importance of diversity in cultural development.

An Event of Great Magnitude

The ICDO team has worked hard to consolidate this festival, which had the support of more than 30 embassies, international organizations, NGOs and volunteers, and the participation of more than 300 performers and 100 artists. The “Long Nights of Interculturality”; is not only a cultural event, but a space for dialogue, mutual understanding, and recognition of the richness that each culture brings to the world.

According to Isabel Arevalos, a cultural activist and artist: “Paraguay’s participation in the 2024 event has not only been a cause of national pride, but also an opportunity to strengthen cultural ties and project the country on the international stage. With this first experience, the Paraguayan delegation is already preparing to continue highlighting in future editions, proudly representing the identity and cultural diversity of the country.”

The Paraguayan community in Vienna, who followed very closely all the cultural event on Saturday Sept. 28 offered a farewell to the representative of the original peoples Don Bruno Barras consistent in a meeting of compatriots and friends of Paraguay to share a succulent beef roast with Paraguayan traditional bori – bori ryguazu soup organized by Julio Franco and his wife Denise Waldbrunner.

The public outcry has reached the courts, but it is still not likely that any of the businessmen convicted, after admitting that they paid minors for sex, will go to jail.

On Monday Murcia’s Provincial Court granted the suspension of the prison sentence to four of the businessmen in the controversial case of teenage prostitution, that in recent weeks has mobilised Murcian society. Given that among them is the main defendant, Juan Castejón – who is facing the longest sentence – everything indicates that none of the defendants will ultimately have to give up their freedom.

The Court held the first hearings on Monday to study whether the prison sentences of the members of this child prostitution network should be carried out or suspended. The seven businessmen, who initially faced sentences totalling up to 25 years in prison each – four years for each contact with a minor – ended up accepting a few weeks ago an agreement with the Prosecutor’s Office by which their sentences were reduced to a maximum of six months for each contact.

The Public Prosecutor’s Office then considered that the extenuating circumstance of undue delays was applicable in view of the significant delay, of up to ten years, for which the case has dragged on.

The defence lawyers arrived at the court on Monday demanding compliance with an agreement in which, they maintained, the suspension of the sentences was included and which led the businessmen to please guilty to the facts. “What has been agreed must be fulfilled,” stressed Joaquín Sánchez, Defence attorney for two of the convicted businessmen, at the door of the Murcia courts.

Once in court, however, the Public Prosecutor’s Office surprised everyone by announcing that it would request the imprisonment of the main defendants in the case. “The system cannot fail these girls again,” stressed the deputy prosecutor, José Francisco Sánchez Lucerga – who replaced the prosecutor who had initially negotiated this agreement on Monday.

The fact of suspending these prison sentences, stressed the representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, “would mean another breach in the protection that the system has offered these minors.”

The defense attorneys for the convicted men demanded that the prosecution stick to its agreement: “What has been agreed must be fulfilled”

Sánchez Lucerga explained that the sentences imposed on the defendants must, among other things, serve as a general preventive measure. “It is a warning to all,” he stressed. He acknowledged the significant delay suffered in this procedure, but stressed that the defendants had already benefited from an extenuating circumstance that reduced their sentence due to these delays. “If there has been an exception in this case,” he said, “it has already been taken into account.”

The prosecutor also referred to what the victims apparently expressed in the private hearings they held last week with the court, in which they were asked for their opinion on the suspension of the sentences. According to him, five of the victims said they wanted to move on as soon as possible, two did not comment on the matter and another four were against the prison sentences of the convicted businessmen being suspended.

The parties were plunged into a series of individual hearings in which the court addressed each case. The Public Prosecutor’s Office opposed the suspension of the sentence of the main convicted businessman, Juan Castejón, alleging the multiple crimes he committed – he admitted having paid for sex with five of the ten minors who were victims in the case.

The position of the Public Prosecutor’s Office was strongly contested by José María Caballero, the businessman’s defence attorney, who warned of the existence of a “social tsunami” and attributed the prosecutor’s opinion to the movement in the streets. “Every day in this room there are reductions in sentences for very serious crimes and suspensions are being granted without anyone flinching,” he stressed. Caballero added that his client is 74 years old and has no criminal record. The businessman himself emphasised his health problems.

After hearing the parties, the Court granted the suspension of the sentence to this well-known housing developer and former president of the Confederation of Business Organizations of Cartagena (COEC) based on the system of accumulation of sentences. Criminal legislation establishes a maximum limit for effective compliance of the sentence that may not exceed three times the highest sentence imposed on him – in this case, 15 months.

The Court granted him this ‘pardon’ with the condition that he not reoffend for four years, that he not approach or communicate with the victims and that he undergo a behavioural re-education programme in sexual matters. The Prosecutor’s Office has already announced that it will appeal this suspension.

The magistrates also agreed on Monday to suspend the prison sentences of José Antonio Arce, Antonio Giménez and José Jara, three other businessmen convicted of contact with minors. In these cases, the prosecutor did not oppose the suspension of their prison sentences, arguing that their encounters with the teenagers had not been so frequent. The Court also offered them a ‘pardon’ with the obligation not to reoffend, not to approach or communicate with the victims and to undergo this sexual re-education program.

One of the women convicted of recruiting minors for prostitution also sat in the courtroom on Monday. Ruth Karina Dorado, who has eight two-year prison sentences behind also asked the Court not to send her to jail. “I want to apologise for those past events,” she said. “I support my family in Bolivia.” The Court has postponed the decision on this specific case.

The judges also spared Martín Galo from jail, who was sentenced to one year and three months in prison after admitting that he transported the minors to the places where these sexual contacts took place. In his case, the prosecutor had requested that he go to jail, even though the sentence does not add up to two years, because he is considered part of the organisation.

The businessmen convicted of having sexual relations with minors arrived at the Palace of Justice in Murcia amid cries of “shame” and “justice” from a group of demonstrators who were already waiting for the defendants before the opening of the courthouse, armed with banners of “paedophile ‘businessmen'” and “no to impunity.” This Tuesday the Court still has to decide the fate of another six convicted in this controversial case.

The Minister for Equality, Ana Redondo, made clear on Thursday a desire that did not ultimately fit with the decision of the magistrates of the Provincial Court. Asked about the case of the businessmen from Murcia who admitted to having paid in exchange for having sex with minors, Redondo said that she hopes that they will end up in prison, which is where they deserve to be,”

Last Sunday, feminist movements, social organisations, political parties and trade unions gathered at the doors of the Palace of Justice in Murcia to demand a correction of the agreement. This sentence, they stressed, represents “an insulting disregard” for the victims of this network of sexual exploitation and “a perpetuation of the impunity of powerful men”.",Four Murcia businessmen convicted of paying minors for sex are spared jail,"The public outcry has reached the courts, but it is still not likely that any of the businessmen convicted, after admitting that they paid minors for sex, will go to jail.
“What has been agreed must be fulfilled,” stressed Joaquín Sánchez, Defence attorney for two of the convicted businessmen, at the door of the Murcia courts.

Paul McCartney recently launched 2024 edition of his Got Back World Tour. The former Beatles star is three shows into the trek, having kicked things off on October 1 in Montevideo, Uruguay, then played an October 5-6 stand at River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Videos by American Songwriter

So far, one of the highlights of the shows has been McCartney’s first-ever performances of the new Beatles tune, “Now and Then,” which was released in November 2023. Sir Paul has now posted a video clip on his social media pages capturing him playing part of the song at one of the Buenos Aires concerts.

The video shows McCartney singing “Now and Then,” and also cuts to several emotional fans watching in the audience. One fan is seen crying. During the performance, the “Now and Then” music video is shown on a giant screen behind the stage. The clip includes archival footage of The Beatles at various periods of the band’s career, and some scenes incorporate new footage of McCartney and Ringo Starr into the vintage scenes.

Fans React to McCartney’s “Now and Then” Performance

A variety of fans have shared their reactions to McCartney’s performance in the comments section of his Facebook page.

One fan wrote, “What a beautiful song, he brought the Beatles together back again for a moment.”

More About McCartney’s Recent Concerts

McCartney has been playing more than 35 songs during his 2024 shows so far. His October 5 concert in Buenos Aires included a rendition of his 1972 Wings hit “Hi, Hi, Hi,” the first time he’d performed that tune live since 2019.

As with McCartney’s 2023 concerts, the new shows also have featured him doing a virtual duet with John Lennon on “I’ve Got a Feeling.” The performance utilizes footage from The Beatles historic January 1969 performance on the roof of Apple Corps’ headquarters in London.

More About “Now and Then”

“Now and Then” was put together using a demo recorded by Lennon in the late 1970s, to which new vocals and instrumental parts were added by the band’s other members during the 1990s and 2020s. The track was released as a single in November 2023. It also was included on the expanded reissue of The Beatles 1967-1970 compilation (a.k.a. “The Blue Album”), which was released the same month.

About McCartney’s Upcoming 2024 Tour Plans

The next stop on McCartney’s 2024 Got Back Tour will be in Santiago, Chile, on Friday, October 11. Sir Paul will then play several more shows in South America, before visiting Costa Rica and Mexico. This portion of the trek runs through a November 17 concert in Mexico City.

McCartney will then head to Europe for a run of eight performances mapped out from a December 4-5 stand near Paris through a December 18-19 engagement in London.

And when he next goes, I hope he finds time to drop in at the headquarters of the resident army unit, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. For there, he will find a tribute to HMS Antelope, the ship in which his late uncle, Petty Officer Roger 'Bagsy' Baker, served in the ­Falklands War.

The Type 21 frigate now lies for eternity on the seabed of San Carlos Water. And so, too, might Uncle Roger had he not abandoned ship on May 23, 1982, along with the rest of the crew.

Moments later, she was blown apart in a colossal explosion which became one of the enduring images of the Falklands War.

Days later, Royal Navy divers retrieved two deckplates bearing the ship's name and sent one of them to Antelope's ­affiliated regiment, the Fusiliers, at their home in the Tower. There, it was installed in the doorway. It means that, to this day, you cannot enter without setting foot on HMS Antelope – a ship with a noble story.

Keir Starmer paid tribute to his Falklands War veteran uncle Roger Baker at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday

Like the families of all those who served in the Falklands, Sir Keir is rightly proud of what his uncle did in the Spring of 1982.

And so he had a ready response to the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, during this week's Prime Minister's Questions when he was asked about the future of the Falklands.

Given Labour's feeble surrender of British ­sovereignty over the Chagos Islands the previous week, it remains a concern.

'My uncle nearly lost his life when his ship was torpedoed defending the ­Falklands,' Sir Keir replied. 'They are British, and they will remain British. I have been very clear about the Falklands. It is personal to me.'

Uncle Roger was the younger brother of Sir Keir's late mother, Josephine, and died in 2016, one year after his sister, at 67.

Sir Keir has once or twice told of how his mother was glued to the radio, ­listening for news of her brother. But I am surprised that we have not heard him mentioned more often.

For Uncle Roger not only ended up as part of the judiciary – like his nephew, Keir, a former head of the Crown Prosecution Service – but he was, palpably, a good egg, whatever your politics.

He dodged a watery grave in the South Atlantic, returned to the UK but was back in Falklands waters again within months.

After a long career in the Royal Navy, Uncle Roger then became a pillar of Plymouth community, liked by all, except the local ­criminal elements.

After the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was questioned in parliament, Sir Keir said: 'My uncle nearly lost his life when his ship was torpedoed defending the ­Falklands. They are British, and they will remain British'

In addition to working for security at Plymouth's Drake Circus shopping centre, he also served as a magistrate. One local remembers him as a 'robust' ­justice of the peace, rather than a bleeding heart liberal. Another recalls he was a uniting force, organising social events and ­dinners for magistrates.

Roger Baker was also a ­stalwart at annual reunions for the crew of Antelope. 'We all enjoyed ­Roger's company enormously,' his former commanding officer, Nick Tobin, tells me. 'He was a very good petty officer and a great character.'

Captain Tobin recalls that Mr Baker often brought his wife, Cecilia, known as 'Ce', and son, Derek, along. 'Everyone liked seeing them. We had no idea that Keir Starmer was his nephew.'

Like other veterans, he gently points out that Antelope was not actually 'torpedoed', as Sir Keir stated, but bombed by Argentine Air Force jets. But none are bothered about a technicality. They are pleased that their efforts have been recognised in Parliament.

Listening to Captain Tobin, and reading his fascinating private memoir, Forty Seven Days, it is easy to see why the crew of Antelope were such a close-knit band. One day they were undergoing sea trials off Portland in April 1982 and then, 30 hours later, they set sail for the Falklands.

Captain Tobin remembers his attempts to keep up ship's morale, even organising an Easter Egg hunt. At one point, he used the ship's helicopter to shoo away a killer whale interested in a ship's diver attaching straps to a supply crate dropped by an aircraft.

No sooner had they reached the South Atlantic than they were tasked with picking up a mixed crowd from newly-liberated South Georgia. They included members of the elite Argentinian special forces, one of whom was a suspected war criminal.

On May 23, Antelope was guarding supply ships in a stretch of water known as 'Bomb Alley'.

'There wasn't a cloud in the sky,' recalls former Petty Officer John Ashdown, then 26, who remembers Roger Baker as a 'friendly, popular shipmate'. No one, however, was enjoying the sunshine. 'We'd have been happier with rain. Then the aircraft came in.'

Capt Tobin recalls how his crew let rip with everything from ­missiles to small arms as the first wave of enemy Skyhawks attacked – and missed.

On the second run, one of the planes burst into flames but not before dropping a bomb which hit the ship towards the stern above the engine room, killing 18-year-old steward, Mark Stephens, and wounding others. However, it did not explode. Nor did the bomb which cracked open the Petty Officers' mess in a third wave.

The bomb disposal team were faced with a choice of pushing two unstable 1,000lb bombs over the side or defusing them in situ. The experts decided the safest option was the latter.

To everyone's dismay, both bombs turned out to be British. 'They had been part of an export drive during the 1970s,' Capt Tobin reflects dryly.

However, as Staff Sergeant Jim Prescott was doing his best, the first bomb exploded, killing him and wounding Warrant Officer John Phillips. Both were later ­decorated (Capt Tobin received the Distinguished Service Cross).

Fires spread through the ship. Only when all the power, electrics and fire-fighting equipment had failed, did Capt Tobin issue the order to abandon ship.

Lifeboats and landing craft were on standby to get everyone off – the captain last. A few minutes later, the whole thing went up.

The skipper watched her burn through the night and then sink at dawn. 'Our fine ship had borne the brunt of air attacks on May 23,' he wrote. 'The miss-targeting by the Argentinians on warships rather than support vessels meant that these ships could discharge vital supplies, ultimately ensuring an Argentinian defeat.'

The crew were picked up by a commandeered North Sea ferry, the Norland, and put aboard the QE2 bound for home. Two of the ship's company immediately returned to the South Atlantic aboard HMS Amazon. One was Petty Officer Roger Baker.

Little wonder that Sir Keir Starmer felt moved to mention his uncle in the Commons this week. Let us hope he also remembers him, and his shipmates, when Argentina reaffirm claims on the Falklands with renewed post-­Chagos vigour, as they surely will in the months ahead.","As Keir Starmer cites family link while pledging to defend Falklands, ROBERT HARDMAN explores how the PM's Uncle Roger was bombed on HMS Antelope, saw crewmates die but survived its sinking... then we","As Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer can expect to be invited to the occasional VIP event at the Tower of London.

He was arrested and prosecuted in 2015 for his participation in the kidnapping and disappearance of a woman in 1977 but was later declared unable to stand trial due to health reasons.

Ernesto Guillermo Villarruel was a captain and head of intelligence for the Third Infantry Regiment of La Tablada, Buenos Aires Province. This regiment managed the clandestine detention center El Vesubio, one of the deadliest of the dictatorship era.

Villarruel was arrested during the 2015 elections when he went to vote and was prosecuted shortly after by Federal Judge Daniel Rafecas. He was 71 at the time.

On February 17, 1977, Villarruel ordered his Infantry regiment to raid the home of Mario Rubén Arrosagaray and Guillermina Silvia Vázquez under suspicion of “subversive” activities. The couple was part of the militant organization Montoneros. Arrosagaray managed to escape. Vázquez, on the other hand, was captured and seen for the last time at El Vesubio.

Villarruel was prosecuted for ordering the operation that led to Vázquez’s illegal detention and disappearance. However, in December 2016, he was deemed unfit to stand trial due to health reasons and released from the psychiatric clinic where he served pre-trial detention during that time.

According to the court’s medical experts, he had Alzheimer’s disease and was unable to understand the charges.

Witnesses have also accused him of being involved in the “Monte Grande massacre,” in which a group of 16 El Vesubio detainees were transferred to a house and shot dead. The military set up the scene to make it look like a shootout in which they had overpowered the “subversive” group.

Victoria Villarruel has always been proud of her military family. A staunch public defender of the military, she founded the Center for Legal Studies on Terrorism and their Victims (Celtyv by its Spanish initials) in 2006 to seek reparations for those who died in actions carried out by guerrillas before and during the dictatorship.

She has admitted to visiting several military officers who were in jail or house arrest but explained she was just doing interviews for her 2009 book, They called them…the idealist youth about guerrilla fighters in the 1970s.

Victoria often talks about her father, a Malvinas war veteran who participated in the military’s 1975 “Independence Operation” to eliminate guerrilla groups reportedly settling in rural areas of Tucumán. She thanks him and her grandfather for teaching her, “We had to fight for our values.” But she never mentions her uncle.

She is on an official visit to Spain and will continue her agenda as scheduled, a source close to her confirmed to the Herald.

One of the detainees was a 16-year-old teenager, who was released from the police station within an hour of being detained.

“It was an excessively large operation, with special forces and groups from the Federal Police, the Navy Police, Gendarmerie, Airport Police, and City Police,” said Roberto Cipriano, the lead of the Provincial Commission for Memory, a Buenos Aires province public human rights organization.

The police had fenced off Congress, and the protest was peaceful until the deputies voted to uphold the veto on university financing. When the news broke, most organizations and political parties vacated the area where the demonstrations against Milei were being held outside the legislative building.

A libertarian influencer, Fran Fijap, arrived on the scene to celebrate the vote and ask provocative questions to remaining demonstrators. Some demonstrators threw drinks in his direction and physically assaulted him, and he ran and hid in a pizzeria, escorted by plainclothes police officers.

Those officers then threw pepper spray at the demonstrators, Cipriano told the Herald outside Congress, just minutes after the detentions. “They were doing illegal intelligence work,” he added.

School supplies spilled from his backpack as he shouted his name and ID card number at the behest of a journalist recording the scene. City Police told the Herald that he was not taken to a police station and promptly released on the spot.

Another one of the detainees had been previously arrested in June near Congress, during a demonstration against the government’s sweeping Ley Bases reform package.

Five of the detainees of legal age were charged with resisting arrest, and a sixth got an additional property damage charge, a spokesperson for the City Police told to the Herald, claiming that a Security Ministry truck had been damaged. The source added that two police officers were injured.

A spokesperson for SAME, the City’s emergency care agency, said that they treated five patients. Fijap had mild head trauma and was transferred to the Ramos Mejia Hospital, a young woman had a panic attack on the streets, and a 74-year-old man fainted.

Cipriano said they counted 18 people who had been affected by the Police’s pepper spray or beatings, including three journalists and a member of the commission he presides over.

Pope Francis on Monday received the vice president of Argentina, Victoria Villarruel, in a meeting in which they discussed the situation in the country and exchanged gifts.

The meeting, which lasted about an hour, took place in the library of the Apostolic Palace in an atmosphere of “great affection,” according to the official statement.

Villarruel, who is also the president of the Senate, shared a video on X that showed the moment the pope greeted her with a cordial “Nice to see you.” With his usual sense of humor, he responded to the question “How are you?” by saying: “Very well, still alive. Are you surviving?” Villarruel replied: “I’m so happy to see you standing,” alluding to the pope’s recent public appearances in a wheelchair.

During the conversation, which covered various topics, the pontiff showed interest in the situation in Argentina and thanked her for the visit, to which Villarruel responded: “Thank you, Holy Father, for receiving me.”

The vice president gave the pope a statuette of a horse with its foal and a Spanish sweet. Francis, for his part, gave her a blessed rosary, a book about the historic blessing given in March 2020 with the phrase “No one is saved alone,” and a message of peace signed especially for her.

As she said goodbye, Villarruel said: “I pray for you, but you pray for me, okay?”

What is Victoria Villarruel’s connection to the Catholic Church?

Victoria Villarruel is a practicing Catholic who has participated in pilgrimages to the national shrine of Our Lady of Luján and has shared greetings on social media during Easter.

Last November, Argentine priest Javier Olivera Ravasi told ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, that he personally met Villarruel, who was the godmother of a person baptized in his chapel.

“She has a strong and determined personality; she’s from a military family; she’s Catholic, Roman apostolic and practicing,” related the priest, who also mentioned that Villarruel attends the Traditional Latin Mass.

Villarruel has spoken out against abortion, saying she defends “the right to life because it begins at conception,” not for religious reasons, but for “pure biology,” according to El País.

In 2018, she attended a Mass for Life in Luján and has expressed her intention to repeal the country’s abortion law, although she noted that the priority at the moment is the economic crisis.

In December, after taking office, Villarruel met with the bishop of the military diocese of Argentina, Santiago Olivera, who gave her an image of the Argentine saint Father Jose Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, wishing her his protection in her administration.

Later, she also met with the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge García Cuerva, and expressed her desire to visit the shrine of the Virgin of Luján to give thanks and pray for the country.

""In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly,"" Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Harry Styles said in the statement.

They added that the memories they shared ""will be treasured forever.""

""For now, our thoughts are with his family, his friends, and the fans who loved him alongside us,"" the statement said. ""We will miss him terribly. We love you Liam.""

Following the band's joint statement, Styles, Tomlinson and Malik offered their own tributes on their personal Instagram accounts, with Tomlinson and Malik saying they had lost a brother.

Styles said his friend's ""greatest joy was making other people happy, and it was an honour to be alongside him as he did it.""

""The years we spent together will forever remain among the most cherished years of my life,"" Styles said. ""I will miss him always, my lovely friend.""

Styles said Payne ""lived wide open, with his heart on his sleeve, he had an energy for life that was infectious,"" adding that he was ""warm, supportive, and incredibly loving.""

Tomlinson said Payne ""was somebody I looked up to everyday, such a positive, funny, and kind soul.""

Tomlinson said he and Payne had discussed getting back in the studio together ""to try and recreate the writing chemistry we had built up in the band.""

""And for the record, Liam was in my opinion the most vital part of One Direction,"" Tomlinson wrote. ""His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on. Thank you for shaping us Liam.""

In a message to Payne, Tomlinson said, ""I feel beyond lucky to have had you in my life but I’m really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye,"" adding that he's grateful they got even closer since the band went on hiatus.

In his post, Malik said that he has ""found myself talking out loud"" to Payne and that ""I never got to thank you for supporting me through some of the most difficult times in my life.""

He called his friend ""headstrong, opinionated"" and said he ""secretly respected"" Payne throughout all of the times they butted heads.

""I was always happy to know, no matter what happened on stage we could always rely on you to know which way to steer the ship next,"" Malik wrote.

Malik said he ""can't explain to you what I'd give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly.""

""I hope that wherever you are right now you are good and are at peace and know how loved you are,"" he said.

In an Instagram story posted Saturday, Malik announced that he'll be postponing the U.S. leg of his first solo tour, Stairway To The Sky, ""given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week."" The tour was scheduled to kick off Wednesday in San Francisco but will be postponed to January.

""Love you all and thank you for your understanding,"" he wrote.

Horan released his own statement paying tribute to Payne on Friday morning. ""I'm absolutely devastated about the passing of my amazing friend, Liam. It just doesn't seem real,"" he wrote on Instagram.

""Liam had an energy for life and a passion for work that was infectious. He was the brightest in every room and always made everyone feel happy and secure,"" he wrote.

One Direction shot to international stardom after it formed on “The X Factor” in 2010. The group has been on indefinite hiatus since 2016. Malik left the band before it went on hiatus.

Simon Cowell, who is widely credited with forming the band on the show and who signed them to his record label SYCO following the competition, posted a statement on Instagram on Friday.

""I am truly devastated. Heartbroken. And I feel empty,"" it read. ""I want you to know how much love and respect I have for you. Every tear I have shed is a memory of you.""

Cowell went on to describe how Payne visited him last year ""just to sit and talk."" He said Payne spoke of his pride about being a father and the ""fun times"" he had spent with Cowell. Cowell said that after Payne left, he was reminded that Payne was still the ""sweet, kind boy"" he met years ago.

Since their split, the band members have embarked on solo careers. Payne signed with Republic Records in 2016.

One Direction sold more than 50 million records throughout its stint in the spotlight, and in 2014, it became the first group to have its first four albums debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, according to Billboard.

Payne, 31, died Wednesday after he fell from the third floor of a hotel in Argentina, local authorities said.

Sistema de Atencion Medica de Emergencia (SAME), the emergency health service, said Payne fell from the balcony in Palermo.

Police were called to the hotel for reports of an aggressive man, according to the emergency services agency, which later confirmed Payne's death.

Hotel staff members made the emergency call to report destructive behavior after someone had ""overindulged on drugs and alcohol,"" according to a transcript of the call that did not name Payne.

The caller said police were needed ""urgently"" because the subject of the call was at risk. The caller added that subject was in a room with a balcony and that ""we are a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,"" according to audio obtained via local media by Telemundo.

Payne was found minutes after the 911 call, and when paramedics found him, there was no possibility of resuscitation, officials said.

An autopsy determined that Payne had 25 injuries ""compatible with those produced by a fall from height"" and that his cause of death was ""polytraumatism, internal and external hemorrhage,"" the Argentina National Prosecutor’s Office said.

The office added that the autopsy findings indicate Payne ""could have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness.""

A number of substances were found in Payne's hotel room, the prosecutor's office said in a statement, which would prove alcohol and drug consumption. The office said Payne was alone when he fell.

According to Corriere dello Sport via Sport Witness, Santiago Castro will not leave Bologna in January despite growing interest from Premier League sides. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Everton are all thought to keep tabs on the Argentine following a good start to life in Serie A.

Santiago Castro, a player in demand

It’s not unprecedented for teams to invest heavily in young South American talents, but Bologna might have taken a risk that is paying off now. Santiago Castro arrived from Velez Salsfield in a €12 million deal last January, but he was not seen as the immediate replacement for Manchester United star Joshua Zirkzee.

Instead, Bologna spent around €15 million to sign Toulouse forward Thijs Dallinga, although it’s Castro who seems like the replacement for the Dutchman. The 20-year-old Argentine attacking sensation has been scoring with regularity of late, which has caught the attention of Premier League sides.

Among those showing an interest, the likelihood of those sides approaching in January is remote. For instance, Arsenal are named as a suitor, but they might stick to their guns in the winter window, although Benjamin Sesko remains their primary target.

Similarly, Chelsea are reportedly keen, but they have other targets in mind, although Enzo Mresca seems content with his options at the moment. They do hold an interest in Victor Osimhen, although a January approach for the Nigerian seems unlikely. Aston Villa might have chosen to continue keeping tabs, but the recent renewal of Jhon Duran’s contract will not see the club search for a new striker.

Bologna unlikely to sell in January

Bologna might look at the growing interest in Castro and could think about making a profit on their investment from a year ago. However, they are unlikely to sell him in January, especially if he continues on his impressive form and goes on to have a good season.

Everton might be the only realistic suitor that could make a bid for the 20-year-old Argentine attacking sensation. However, the Toffees are not planning to part ways with either Beto or Dominic Calvert-Lewin, meaning they could struggle to sign a new forward despite the duo coming into January with a delicate contractual situation.","Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton need to wait until the summer to sign Santiago Castro","Santiago Castro is attracting big interest from Premier League sides, although Bologna are unlikely to sell the Argentine striker in January.

The loss of life, especially a young person’s life, is always a tragedy.

For some young fans, this might be the first person they “know” who has died. While it may not be the same as losing a family member or close friend, the feeling of loss is significant. Young fans will need support. And in 2024, many will find this support through social platforms and online forums.

I still remember the impact the deaths of stars such as Kurt Cobain and Jeff Buckley had on people like me who were teenagers in the 1990s. These were artists I admired and listened to - and whose art I relied on during times of pleasure and pain.

A similar pang was felt when artists such as George Michael, Aretha Franklin and David Bowie died, albeit later in my life and theirs.

The experience of losing a music idol is in many ways a universal one. People whose art we attach to our own life experiences become inseparable from our lives. And when they die, it can feel like those experiences are over too.

After news of Payne’s death broke, hundreds of fans took to the streets of Palermo in Buenos Aires, where Payne had been visiting. They held a vigil, cried and consoled one another in front of the Casa Sur hotel where Payne had been staying.

One fan, 25-year-old Yamila Zacarias, probably spoke for many when she said: “He meant a lot to me because the band came into my life at this time when you’re trying to be a part of something, and being a One Direction fan became that something for me.”",Commentary: The pang of losing a music idol like One Direction's Liam Payne is universal,"IMPACT ON FANSThe loss of life, especially a young person’s life, is always a tragedy.

“As I try to navigate this Earth shattering event, and work through my own grief at this indescribably painful time, I’d like to kindly remind everyone that we have lost a human being,” Cheryl, 41, shared via Instagram on Friday, October 18, alongside a photo of Liam and their son. “Liam was not only a pop star and celebrity, he was a son, a brother, an uncle, a dear friend and a father to our 7-year-old son. A son that now has to face the reality of never seeing his father again.”

She continued, “What is troubling my spirit the most is that one day Bear will have access to the abhorrent reports and media exploitation we have seen in the past two days. It is breaking my heart further that I cannot protect him from that in his future.”

“I am begging you to consider what use some of these reports are serving, other than to cause further harm to everyone left behind picking up the pieces. Before you leave comments or make videos, ask yourself if you would like your own child or family to read them.”

She concluded her message by writing, “Please give Liam the little dignity he has left in the wake of his death to rest in some peace at last.”

Liam died after he “jumped from the balcony of his room” at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 16. He was 31 years old. Shortly before he died, the manager of the hotel called the police to report and described Liam as an “aggressive man possibly under the influence of drugs or alcohol.”

“When he is conscious he breaks, he is breaking the whole room. Well, we need you to send someone, please,” the manager said in the audio shared by Telemundo. Later in the call, the employee explained, “The guest is in a room that has a balcony and, well, we are a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening.”

Liam and Cheryl, 41, first met when he auditioned for X Factor in 2008. She was a judge alongside Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh, and remained on the panel when Liam returned two years later.

Nothing romantically developed between the pair until she filed for divorce from her second husband, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, in February 2016. Three months later, the Girls Aloud artist and Liam went public with their romance and welcomed their son, Bear, in March 2017. The following July, Liam announced that he and Cheryl split after two years of dating.

“Cheryl and I are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It’s been a tough decision for us to make,” he wrote via X at the time. “We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.”

The pair continued to coparent their son until his untimely death.

Liam’s family and friends broke their silence shortly after news broke of his tragic death, and his family shared how “utterly devastated” they were by the news.

“We are heartbroken,” the One Direction alum’s family told Daily Mail in a Thursday, October 17, statement. “Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.”

The U.K. native’s former 1D bandmate Louis Tomlinson shared a heartfelt message via Instagram later that day alongside a photo with Liam on stage.

“Liam was an incredible song writer with a great sense of melody, we often spoke of getting back in the studio together to try and recreate the writing chemistry we had built up in the band,” Louis, 32, wrote. “And for the record, Liam was in my opinion the most vital part of One Direction. His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on. Thank you for shaping us Liam.”

Harry Styles’ mother, Anne Twist, also broke her silence via Instagram by sharing a post of a heartbreak emoji over a black background.

But how can investigators tell — and what is pink cocaine, anyway? Here’s what you need to know about the substance.

It’s important to note that so far, reports that Payne took pink cocaine are based on anonymous sources. Argentine prosecutors haven’t announced any conclusions beyond last week’s preliminary autopsy, so this claim isn’t official yet. The full results for toxicology tests typically take around two weeks, according to University of Buenos Aires toxicology professor Carlos Damin.

What is the ‘pink cocaine’ Liam Payne reportedly consumed before his death?

Despite its name, pink cocaine is not chemically related to cocaine. It’s also known as tusi or tusibi, because it is often confused with the hallucinogenic drug 2C-B — but it’s not related to that, either. Pink cocaine is actually a cocktail of drugs, the precise ingredients of which vary from dealer to dealer. It’s often expensive and associated with higher socioeconomic classes.

“They call it pink cocaine because people sniff it,” Damin said. Real 2C-B is a “cousin of amphetamines and MDMA,” he added.

In Argentina, it usually contains MDMA (also known as ecstasy or molly) or derivatives of methamphetamines combined with a hallucinogen such as ketamine or LSD, according to Damin. It is colored with food coloring, strawberry flavoring, or even raspberry jelly, one harm reduction specialist told the Herald.

Since it’s not a specific drug, investigators would not be able to do a specific test for pink cocaine, noted Damin, who is not involved in the investigation into Payne’s death. However, tests could detect that someone had consumed both ketamine and MDMA. If investigators also saw what appeared to be a pink powder drug in the hotel room where Payne was staying, that could lead them to conclude that he’d consumed the cocktail.

According to Colombian drug harm reduction NGO Échele Cabeza, people have been consuming pink cocaine on a large scale since at least 2010. However, it exploded in the South American party scene after the Colombian magazine Semana reported in 2012 that 2C-B was a pricey hot commodity favored by the elites.

Échele Cabeza warned that this had the effect of “marketing” the drug. “We saw how in a matter of weeks, the drug trafficking market adjusted, prepared, falsified a substance that people were asking for just because it was the drug of ‘models, queens, actors, and politicians,’” the organization said in 2018. The substance that dealers concocted in response rarely, if ever, contains 2C-B, and only ever in minimal quantities.

Since then, pink cocaine, or tusi, has proliferated all over South America. The first police raid of a so-called “pink cocaine lab” in Argentina was in 2021, and dealers offering the substance were arrested in Bolivia and Paraguay in the same year.

Pink cocaine and the elevator shaft mystery

One of the most striking cases involving pink cocaine in recent years in Argentina was that of Brazilian medicine student Ana Karolina Fernández.

In September of 2020, she and her boyfriend headed to his friend’s flat after a night out partying. They drank into the small hours, after which Fernández fell asleep, and the two men decided to move to a different room, according to their statements to the police.

When they returned, Fernández had disappeared. Alarmed, they started to look for her. She was nowhere to be found, but they noticed something strange: the elevator door was open, but the elevator itself was not there.

Firefighters found Fernández’s body at the bottom of the elevator shaft later that day. She had fallen from the fourteenth floor and died of her injuries.

An investigation into the circumstances surrounding Fernández’s death was launched. Some media outlets reported that pink cocaine was found at the property, although police later denied this. The judiciary later said that she appeared to have died in an accident after the elevator failed while she was under the influence of alcohol. There is no evidence that she had consumed the drug before her death.

Dangers of pink cocaine

The drugs typically found in pink cocaine can cause serious problems, including psychosis, heart arrhythmia, and serotonin syndrome, according to Damin, who served as head of toxicology at the Buenos Aires Fernández Hospital for 18 years.

He also warned that MDMA in Argentina is often adulterated. A common adulterant is the stimulant cathinone, which scientists believe causes the psychoactive effects of khat, a leaf that is cultivated and chewed in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.

Adulteration isn’t limited to MDMA: in February 2022, 24 people died, and more than 80 were hospitalized in Greater Buenos Aires after consuming adulterated cocaine.

Instead, they have ended up working for years with no pay and found themselves unable to retire when they age — even when they suffer serious health problems.

Over the years, several of them have filed legal complaints — but none have prospered. Then, in September 2024, Argentine federal prosecutors handed down a bombshell indictment accusing high-ranking members of the Roman Catholic organization Opus Dei of human trafficking and slave labor. It is the first time an organization within the Catholic Church has faced accusations of this magnitude.

Although there are 44 cases cited in the investigation, only four are included in the human trafficking indictment because most occurred before Argentina’s human trafficking law went into force in May 2008. Due to statutory limitations, three may soon be out of time.

The Herald spoke to Paula Bistagnino (pictured), an investigative journalist and author whose work was cited in the judicial proceedings, about the inner workings of the highly insular and influential institution. Bistagnino went into the details of the Opus Dei, how the charges came about, and the importance of the indictment.

For many international readers, the words “Opus Dei” might be reminiscent of a Dan Brown novel or conspiracy fodder. Could you explain what the Opus Dei is?

It’s the Catholic church’s only prelature [ecclesiastical jurisdiction] that’s allowed to function autonomously. It has a pretty secretive operation with very rigorous practices imposed on its lay members, who are called “numeraries.” These include self-flagellation, vows of chastity and poverty, and obedience. They have super strict everyday rules, including “mortifications” and sacrifices with intense spiritual control. It operates within a hierarchy that practically doesn’t allow members to make decisions for themselves.

When you hear about it, it sounds anachronistic, out of our time, right? But it’s being upheld, it’s outlined in their internal statutes. Even Opus Dei members in Spain have denounced that those statutes are different from those they present to the Catholic Church. It’s not exactly two-faced but there’s at least a hidden face to the organization, clearly. Dan Brown is literature, fiction, but there are elements that are true.

What exactly has the Argentine judiciary presented against the Opus Dei?

This is a judicial case that stemmed from an individual criminal complaint from a lawyer who read media coverage of the Opus Dei. He filed a complaint with the state anti-trafficking agency, PROTEX. Through the women involved and multiple witnesses, PROTEX can depict a system of recruitment, capture, and exploitation. In the end, there are 44 cases of women who were subjected to this between the 1980s and 2015. The complaint was filed in the federal judiciary, which continued the investigation alongside Procuraduría.

Based on that, we get the accusation against Opus Dei’s maximum authorities of human trafficking and labor exploitation over the past 40 years. Most of the Opus Dei consists of laypeople, but its upper echelons are religious: five priests who led the organization over the years stand accused. Four were regional vicars, the maximum authority of the region (in this case, Rio de la Plata), and one was in charge of the feminine branch.

What we have now isn’t just a complaint, it’s an indictment based on the investigation. The prosecutor’s office handed it over to Federal Judge Daniel Rafecas, who’s asking for a few additional measures before summoning these religious authorities to testify and explain how this system works.

Why is this indictment significant?

It’s the first time the Catholic church has been accused of having an organization within it commit the crime of human trafficking — well, women specifically — and it’s the first mass complaint case against the Opus Dei for such serious crimes in its almost 100 years of existence. There have also been cases against individuals or civil associations linked to it, but never against its senior leaders.

There have been smaller complaints but they didn’t go anywhere. That a case of this scale and seriousness is making its way through the courts is truly historic.

Why was there such secrecy around the investigation?

It was fundamental that PROTEX works with its usual secrecy because it is about human trafficking. But there’s always that risk of it being leaked, particularly when you are investigating a powerful organization with access to the judiciary. Many of these women were contacted by the organization to discourage them from filing their complaints. If the case had come to light, Opus Dei’s habit of trying to annul the testimonies or frighten them out of going through with their case would have been a higher risk. The closed-off houses of the Opus Dei were also monitored successfully without the organization knowing about it because of that secrecy.

Are the four cases being used to prosecute the Opus Dei related to assistant numeraries? Who are they?

Yes. The four of them were taken as children and cleaned houses. There are many Opus Dei categories, but you basically have priests and numeraries. Numeraries are lay members who make vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, self-flagellate, and submit to a very strict spiritual discipline of meeting everyday rituals. There are like 20 everyday rituals of obeisance and you sign a document to enter the organization.

Then the organization incorporated a lower category, “assistant numeraries” — basically for poor women taken from their families, a category that implied being servants to numeraries for life. The organization has dedicated itself to finding such people in every country it’s in. Why? Because they wouldn’t hire just anyone. It’s a closed-off, highly hermetic institution. They needed people inside who wouldn’t get out, who wouldn’t be able to talk about what was going on within.

How were these girls taken from their families and placed within the Opus Dei?

There are cases of girls from the age of 12. In Argentina, a well-known Opus Dei school opened in the 1970s in Bellavista, where I lived. These girls who lived in very poor, rural areas in large families far away from cities were scouted, and their parents [were told the girls would have] access to a Catholic school and a profession in hospitality, saying they would be able to have a job and a better future. With that ruse, they were taken far away from their homes. That’s what the judicial investigation is set to prove. Once they were at the school, it was like an internment camp thousands of kilometers away from their families, with communications cut off — coming from poverty, they often didn’t have access to a telephone. We’re talking from the 1970s and into the 2000s. Once there, the schools would start coercing them into believing that they had the “vocation to serve” and had to enter the Opus Dei.

“…there are still women entering the organization in those conditions, they’re still Opus Dei servants, and although they’ve changed some of the rules, the process is the same.”

Have the Opus Dei or more mainstream Catholic organizations responded to the new investigation?

They’ve published a communiqué denying the accusations publicly. They always publish communiqués denying everything, mostly because they’re for their followers — they’re seeing headlines with strong accusations, they publish a communiqué.

And I think it’s too soon, but the Vatican hasn’t taken any measures, not even when the women made their case to the Pope in 2021. The first thing they did was go to the press and make their case at the Vatican. That got no answer, although Pope Francis did later make some moves to limit the Opus Dei’s authority, like calling for a change in its statutes. But he didn’t formally say he was responding to the presentation.

What would you want to see happen next?

Every woman I’ve interviewed over the years has said she wanted justice. Although they’ve changed some things, there are still women entering the organization in those conditions, they’re still Opus Dei servants, and although they’ve changed some of the rules, the process is the same.

I think it’s important that this judicial case keeps growing across the region because these weren’t the only women affected. This happened all over Latin America, in Europe, and beyond. There are testimonies in Spain and in Ireland, where a case is also being opened. Right now, it may seem like a small group in Argentina was doing this, but it was part of a systematic working matrix by the organization across the world.

What would you say to Opus Dei authorities if you could?

They have the opportunity to repair the damage that they caused to many people who trusted them and also worked for them. When Opus Dei responds they say these women were “part of the family.” Instead of denying it the way they have and even putting them down, accusing these women of lying, they could ask for forgiveness, implement reparations, and change their operating model.

In any case, that’s what I said before this indictment in the judiciary. Now, they have to answer the summons, and the justice system will decide.

Although there are 44 cases cited in the investigation, only four are included in the human trafficking indictment because most occurred before Argentina’s human trafficking law went into force in May 2008.

Gur-Aryeh issued the warning in remarks during an online press conference with Nicaraguan journalists working in exile on the subject of Israel-Nicaraguan relations — organized by the Israeli Diplomatic Mission in Costa Rica after communist dictator Daniel Ortega recently ordered the rupture of Nicaragua’s diplomatic ties with Israel.

“I can say that there are also other countries in the region that have Iran and Hezbollah bases, and in particular Venezuela and Bolivia,” Gur-Aryeh told journalists.

The Israeli diplomat stated that her government is following Hezbollah’s presence and that “when we see that there is an opportunity to stop these terrorists, we cooperate with governments on the American continent.”

Gur-Aryeh was asked if Israel maintains cooperation with the United States in Latin America against Hezbollah, which the diplomat responded affirmatively.

“It is very, very close … We share information,” she said, stressing that she “cannot say more than that in the media” due to the nature of the intelligence.

The Iranian regime, and its proxy terror group Hezbollah, has maintained a decades-long presence in the region that has dramatically increased in recent years under the auspices of leftist governments such as Venezuela’s socialist regime — whose dictator Nicolás Maduro publicly lamented the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) airstrike in late September.

Bolivia, led by socialist and pro-Iran President Luis Arce, has been widely denounced by experts as the Islamic regime’s “most successful project” in spreading its influence in the region. Arce’s government has signed several agreements with the Iranian regime, including a deal for the purchase of Iranian-made drones and a highly controversial “memorandum of understanding reportedly on defense and security” whose contents have not been publicly disclosed.

Bolivia is among the leftist-led Latin American nations that broke ties with Israel in response to the start of its self-defense operations against the jihadist terror group Hamas.

While Ambassador Gur-Aryeh did not disclose specific details to the Nicaraguan journalists, she listed Hezbollah’s terrorist attacks against Israeli targets in Argentina as an example, and asserted that the Israeli government “clearly knows that they were handled inside the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires.”

The Argentine government believes Iran, via Hezbollah, is responsible for the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) — the deadliest terrorist attack in the Western Hemisphere prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks.

“We have this information about attacks in the past and I can only say that we are following the situation now as well,” Gur-Aryeh said.

Similarly, the ambassador assured that there is cooperation “all over the world … unfortunately, very close cooperation between terrorist organizations and organized crime.”

“They cooperate very fluidly. In fact, you don’t generally know when organized crime ends and when terrorism begins, because many of these terrorist groups are very, very involved in organized crime,” she asserted.

The Bolivian government rejected Gur-Aryeh’s “irresponsible statements” in a note issued by its Foreign Ministry on Tuesday, in which it claimed that “Bolivia is a pacifist state that promotes the culture of peace, which is why it has constitutionally assumed the prohibition of installing foreign military bases in its territory.”

“Unsubstantiated statements such as the one issued by the Israeli diplomat, seek to generate confrontation between Latin American states, governments and peoples, contrary to the objective outlined in the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) to consolidate Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace,” the statement read.

“The Plurinational State of Bolivia calls upon the brotherly Latin American countries not to fall into these provocations that seek to affect the brotherly relations between states and peoples of the region,” it continued.

Prior to Monday’s press conference, the Ortega regime released a statement condemning other comments made last week by the Israeli Ambassador and Consul Amir Rockman, who accused the communist regime of allowing Iranian-linked terror groups to freely operate in Nicaragua and of turning the country into a “platform for terrorism in the region.”

“Israeli officials claim that in Nicaragua there is now a terrorist base being used as a platform for terrorism in the region. In this regard, Nicaragua rejects such statements, which are aimed at diverting attention from the genocide being carried out by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories,” the statement reportedly read.

He was not injured in the alleged attack that quickly became the latest flashpoint in a power struggle between the ex-leader and his protégé-turned-rival, current President Luis Arce.

Morales, 65, blamed President Arce's government for the outburst of violence, saying it was part of a coordinated campaign by Bolivian authorities to sideline him from politics. The incident coincides with a bitter rift at the highest rungs of the ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS. Morales and Arce, his former economy minister, are fighting to lead the party into next year's elections.

“This is not an isolated incident,” the Morales-aligned bloc of the divided MAS party said in a statement. ""It's clear evidence that we are facing a fascist government that does not hesitate to attack the life of former President Evo Morales.""

The statement said that two vehicles with heavily armed men dressed in black ambushed Morales’ convoy. Bullets whizzed just “centimeters” from the ex-president's head, it said. Video posted on the website of Morales' radio station showed helicopters buzzing over an airstrip where the incident occurred.

President Arce condemned the attack and requested an investigation.

“The exercise of any violent practice in politics must be condemned and clarified,” Arce wrote on social media platform X. “Problems are not resolved by trying to kill people or by partisan speculation.”

Deputy Security Minister Roberto Rios insisted that police had not acted against the former president. He said authorities were investigating a theory that Morales had staged “a possible self-attack,"" citing allegations swirling within the government that Morales had directed the assault on himself to help his own political fortunes.

“Morales is seeking confrontation and violence on the streets for political interests and to achieve impunity,” Rios told reporters.

The flurry of pointed accusations threatened to ignite Bolivia’s political tinderbox and plunge the cash-strapped Andean nation of 12 million further into turmoil.

Morales alleged the shots were fired while he was being driven in Bolivia’s coca leaf-growing region of Chapare, his rural stronghold whose residents have blockaded the main east-west highway for the past two weeks in a show of defiance and solidarity after new legal threats against Morales emerged. Last month, local prosecutors summoned Morales to testify in a revived child abuse case that the former president dismissed as politically motivated.

The roadblocks and rallies over the past days have choked off major cities and disrupted supply lines, raising fears of food and gasoline shortages.

Under pressure to clear the highways, Arce's government on Friday deployed thousands of security officers in a failed attempt to break up the blockades by force.

Officials said protesters drove away police by hurling explosives in clashes that left 14 officers injured, while 40 demonstrators were arrested. Morales said members of a far-right paramilitary group pulled his lawyer, Nelson Cox, out of his jeep and beat him.

The events revived fears of a return to the political violence of 2019, when 36 people were killed in violent turmoil that engulfed the country after allegations of electoral fraud sparked an uprising that ended when Morales resigned and fled.

In the years since, the leftist icon, who served as Bolivia’s first Indigenous president from 2006-2019, has made a stunning comeback, drawing thousands to his rallies across the country.

As Morales' popularity has grown, so, too, has the government backlash. Arce on Saturday said that Morales poses “a serious threat not only to Bolivia, but to stability and security in our region.”

That the political rivalry between the erstwhile allies could morph so quickly into mayhem on the streets is a measure of how brittle Bolivia's democracy remains years after Morales' ouster, decried by his supporters as a coup.

On Sunday, Morales went on his weekly radio show to recount the attack on his convoy, appearing unscathed and calm. He told the radio host that as he was leaving home, hooded men fired at least 14 shots at his car, wounding his driver.

“Arce is going to go down as the worst president in history,” Morales said, describing the attack as part of a conspiracy by Arce’s government to drive him out of politics.“Shooting a former president is the last straw.”

As cellphone footage spread online showing Morales’ driver bleeding from the back of his head, his supporters called for mass rallies to show their anger. In the video taken from inside the car, Morales can be seen in the passenger’s seat holding a phone to his ear as the vehicle swerves and a woman’s voice shrieks, “Duck!”

The footage shows the car’s front windshield cracked by at least three bullets and its rear windshield shattered. Morales can be heard saying, “Papacho has been shot in the head,” into his phone, referring to his driver.

Even before the shots were fired, the country’s political atmosphere was rife with personal attacks and at times violence.

In June there was an attempted coup by a rogue general who later accused Arce of orchestrating the uprising to boost his own flagging popularity. Arce denies being behind the coup.

Last month, in a show of political strength, Morales and his supporters set off on a highly anticipated dayslong march to La Paz, the capital, in an effort to pressure Arce to address dire shortages of fuel and dollars.

Imported goods are scarce. Prices are rising. Drivers wait for hours to fill up at gas stations.

The September march, which also called for authorities to let Morales run in the 2025 presidential contest despite the constitutional court barring him, devolved into street clashes with counter-protesters.

Earlier this month, Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has refused to testify in court.

Payne, who fell from a third-story balcony at a Buenos Aires hotel in Argentina, had multiple substances in his body, including pink cocaine, also known as ""Tuci.""

The drug typically contains a mix of methamphetamine, ketamine, and MDMA.

The allegations stem from a lawsuit by Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones, a former videographer and producer for Diddy, who accused the music mogul of rampant drug use and harassment within his business enterprise.

Jones' lawsuit followed several legal complaints against Combs, including one from his ex, Cassie Ventura, who accused him of sexual abuse.

Over the past three years, Elon Musk has met dozens of times with presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, government officials and political candidates from around the world.

Some of these meetings have been highly publicized, like his visit to Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following criticism over an antisemitic post Musk boosted on X. Other meetings, such as a recent conversation with Argentine President Javier Milei, the world only glimpses through the billionaire’s social media posts.

Known topics of conversation ranged from business opportunities for Musk’s companies to elections and policy issues such as trade, energy, education and population management, according to a CNN review of Musk’s meetings, calls and conversations with political figures around the world since August 2021. Although some of his relationships with those leaders go back even further, in that time, Musk has gone from being one of the world’s wealthiest and most influential businessmen to an increasingly powerful player in global affairs.

Taken together, the meetings show how Musk has been courted not only for his companies and deep pocketbook but also for his ability to impact the course of wars through his Starlink satellite service; his opinion on artificial intelligence, the next major wave of technology development; and his role in swaying public opinion through his platform, X.

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials, including about Starlink, since late 2022. CNN has not independently confirmed the conversations, so they are not included in our analysis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN the report was “absolutely false.” He said Musk and Putin have only ever spoken once, adding that the conversation was over the phone and took place before 2022. Musk’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

For Musk, conversations with world leaders are a virtuous cycle: The six prominent companies he owns or runs give him an in with those figures, whose support often fuels their growth. In turn, those leaders’ interest in attracting Musk’s business provides an opportunity for him to advise on some of his other pet interests, such as global birth rates and immigration.

At the same time, the South Africa-born billionaire has become a political power player in his adopted home, the United States. He held livestream campaign events on X for presidential hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who both later dropped out of the race, as well as former President Donald Trump. Musk has since thrown his weight — and tens of millions of dollars — behind Trump, attending and hosting rallies on his behalf and criticizing (and, in some cases, spreading false information about) his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on X.

“He’s trying to be a global influencer, and I guess he’s decided he needs to do more than use X,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Of course, it’s not unusual for corporate leaders to sometimes meet with government officials, and Musk is not the only big business name to publicly weigh in on the upcoming US presidential election.

But the extent of Musk’s public political involvement is unusual for the chief executive of a public company like Tesla — as well as the owner of several powerful private firms, executive leadership experts told CNN.

“What’s different about it is that there’s a political aspect, and most CEOs steer clear of politics,” Lewis said. “They’re going to the head of another state, basically, to make the commercial conditions better for their product, maybe to lobby on a certain point, but they don’t usually do politics,” he said, adding that with Musk, “there’s a political tone to everything he does.”

At least some of Musk’s political relationships appear to have benefited his companies. In May 2022, Musk met with the then-President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to mark the launch of Starlink in the country, a major new market for the satellite business. In February 2023, he held calls with then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about a new Tesla manufacturing plant in the state of Nuevo Leon, for which the company later received $153 million worth of incentives from the state. In May 2023, he held meetings with Chinese government officials shortly after Tesla announced plans for a new battery plant in Shanghai; Musk made a surprise return to China this April for a visit with Premier Li Qiang, weeks before the company broke ground on the facility.

Even more world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have met with Musk to ask Tesla to invest in their countries.

CNN’s analysis includes only meetings for which at least some information is publicly available. It’s possible the billionaire has calls or meetings with leaders that he does not post about.

“One might say he doesn’t have to pay lobbyists, because he’s his own lobbyist, globally,” said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School who focuses on executive leadership. But, he added, “when you’ve got other people’s money at stake, you have to moderate your activities … when you get into these extremes, you can impact your business.”

Musk has not hesitated to deal in extremes. He’s warned of the downfall of America if Democrats are elected, pushed false conspiracy theories on topics such as mail-in voting and warned in public events of a “woke mind virus” that threatens society’s advancements.

Separately, Musk has also taken heat for boosting an antisemitic conspiracy theory, racist false claims about immigration and the dangerous ‘Pizzagate’ conspiracy, as well as posting a Holocaust joke on X.

Recently, Musk’s political activism has begun to have a tangible impact on his companies: Brands pulled their advertisements from X, tanking its value. And SpaceX earlier this month sued a California regulator after it allegedly denied a bid to allow more rocket launches over the billionaire’s controversial comments, claiming it had violated Musk’s freedom of speech. (The agency did not comment on the suit.)

CNN’s analysis also suggests that Musk has, in particular, worked to develop influence among a set of right-leaning world leaders, including Modi, Bolsonaro, Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

“He’s probably more comfortable with them … these are people who want to meet with him, and not everyone wants to meet with Elon Musk,” Lewis said. “It’s birds of a feather. He likes visiting people who are going to be pleased to be receiving Elon Musk.”

During a conference for Italy’s far-right Brothers of Italy party last year, Musk railed against “illegal immigration” and the “woke mind virus” that he said was gripping the US. Musk called it “evil” and warned of it moving to Italy.

India’s Modi, who was recently reelected for a rare third consecutive term, used his plans for electric vehicle manufacturing growth — including conversations with Musk about a potential Tesla factory — as a campaign talking point, although a meeting in India between the two men earlier this year where Musk was expected to announce the facility was rescheduled.

Musk has also met with Milei multiple times in his first year leading Argentina, during which time the president has faced protests over a huge spike in poverty rates as a result of austerity measures. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” Musk said in an X post following a May meeting between the pair. In another post last month, Musk said, “Milei is bringing prosperity to Argentina.” (Argentina is home to huge stores of lithium, an essential component in batteries like the ones used in Tesla’s cars.)

Now, as he campaigns for Trump, Musk may be setting himself up for his most prominent political role yet: a position in a possible future Trump White House. Musk and Trump have publicly discussed having the billionaire lead a new government efficiency commission — which Musk has jokingly referred to as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency — if the former president is reelected.

It is possible other meetings exist, or other topics were discussed beyond what is publicly available.

Bolivia was the first South American country to use Russian nuclear fuel, said Rosatom's Oleg Grigoriyev

Russia's State Nuclear Energy Corporation Rosatom has completed the first batch of nuclear fuel for the reactor being built in Bolivian city of El Alto for the South American country's Center for Research and Development in Nuclear Technology (CIDTN), it was announced Monday in Moscow. The Russian Government agency also said in a statement that the chemicals manufactured at Rosatom's facilities in Novosibirsk had passed acceptance inspection. The fuel is to be delivered in 2025, it was also explained.

The CIDTN is a joint project seeking to strengthen Rosatom's position in the world market. The CIDTN is currently in the construction phase and will begin operation in stages. The center consists of four components: the Preclinical Radiopharmacy Cyclotron Complex (PRCC) and the Multipurpose Irradiation Center (MIC), both already in operation, while the Radioecology and Radiobiology laboratories are about to be inaugurated and the Research Nuclear Reactor Complex is currently under construction, according to Sputnik News.

With the TVS VRR-M2 fuel, the BR-01 research reactor is expected to produce radioisotopes for scientific research as well as being used in materials studies and for training purposes. The pool-type 200 kW pressurized water research reactor, developed by Russia's Research Institute of Atomic Reactors, is designed to have a service life of 50 years and is part of a Russian-Bolivian project to create a nuclear research and technology center at El Alto, at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters. The research reactor vessel was delivered and installed in its design position in 2023. It will be the world's highest-altitude research reactor.

Bolivia was the first South American country to use Russian nuclear fuel, said Oleg Grigoriyev, Senior Vice President for Commerce and International Business at Rosatom's fuel division TVEL. Rosatom has vast experience in the construction of research reactor facilities abroad and traditionally provides them with nuclear fuel throughout their entire service life, he added. The Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant has been producing nuclear fuel and its components for research reactors in various regions of the world for already 50 years, including facilities of both Russian and foreign design, he went on.

The Cyclotron Preclinical Radiopharmacy Complex is already up and running. It will produce a line of pharmaceuticals to supply Bolivian nuclear medicine centers, thus allowing for quicker and higher quality diagnosis and treatment. The Multipurpose Irradiation Centre has also been completed.

Rosatom announced the signing of the contract with the Bolivian Nuclear Energy Agency in September 2017 for the construction of the nuclear research and technology center in El Alto. Construction of the facility began in July 2021.

But what firmly decided his future career path were two key moments: an opportunity to conduct fieldwork on polka-dot treefrogs in Argentina and reading Sönke Johnsen’s book The Optics of Life. “It was truly inspiring, as it was the first time I discovered a field that combined my passion for frogs, chemistry and physics,” Taboada said. “I read it eagerly, enjoying every moment. Since then, I have become obsessed with the biology of colors.”

Taboada, who runs the Taboada Lab at Vanderbilt, was among the 2024 Packard Fellows for Science and Engineering announced on Tuesday, Oct. 15. The fellowships, which are awarded by The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, provide the nation’s most promising early-career scientists and engineers with flexible funding to take risks and explore new frontiers in their fields of study. Fellows receive $875,000 of unrestricted funds over five years. Packard Fellows have gone on to receive Nobel Prizes, Fields Medals, Alan T. Waterman Awards, Breakthrough Prizes and been elected to the national academies of science, engineering and medicine.

“Professor Taboada’s work beautifully demonstrates what is possible when passion and curiosity drive inquiry across the boundaries that separate disciplines,” Chancellor Daniel Diermeier said. “His investigations into how biochemical and physical processes shape optical traits in frogs are expanding our understanding of biology more broadly. Professor Taboada’s achievements are a testament to the enduring power and value of wonder—and to the kind of discovery that is a university’s unique stock-in-trade. I’m proud to congratulate him on behalf of Vanderbilt.”

According to the foundation’s website, the program is rooted in David Packard’s commitment to strengthening university-based science and engineering programs in recognition that the success of the Hewlett-Packard Company, which he co-founded, was derived in large measure from the research and development in university laboratories.

Taboada worked with Research Development and Support within the Office of the Vice Provost for Research and Innovation to coordinate facets of his application. Out of 99 applicants from 50 universities, 20 fellows were chosen.

“Carlos embodies the spirit of rigorous inquiry and innovation at Vanderbilt. His groundbreaking interdisciplinary research examines the biology of color and amphibian adaptation, deepening our understanding of evolution,” Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs C. Cybele Raver said. “We are proud to have him as our first Packard Fellow; this award will empower him to advance knowledge in biological sciences, benefiting our community and multiple scientific fields.”

After earning his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in biological sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, Taboada pursued a postdoctoral position at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. But it was a fateful message to his literary inspiration that brought him to the U.S. “When I was concluding my Ph.D., I reached out to Johnsen, who authored the book The Optics of Life. I really enjoyed all his work and found it extraordinarily inspiring,” Taboada said. “So, I applied for a Human Frontiers Science Program postdoctoral fellowship to work with him on the transparency of glassfrogs. Fortunately, I was awarded the fellowship in 2018, allowing me to relocate to North Carolina to work with him at Duke University, which was a dream come true.”

After his work at Duke, Taboada joined Vanderbilt University in 2023 as an assistant professor and principal researcher. At the Taboada Lab, he and his team investigate the chemical, physiological and physical mechanisms that create different colors in frogs and the remarkable transparency of glassfrogs. These translucent frogs are of particular interest to Taboada. To maintain their transparency, they hide most of their red blood cells without causing a massive clot, and they can keep up with their metabolic needs without the normal oxygen supply provided by these cells. Taboada’s lab investigates alternative pathways for oxygen uptake and transport in these amphibians, and the effects of non-oxidative metabolism on the normal physiology of the frogs.

“Carlos’s fascinating and impressive research on amphibian evolution helps us to better understand a host of critical biological processes,” said Timothy P. McNamara, Ginny and Conner Searcy Dean of the College of Arts and Science. “This fellowship rightfully recognizes the significance of his work and the promise of his future impact. I am impressed by his contributions to the field of biological sciences, but also, due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of his research, to scholarship across the College of Arts and Science as a whole.”

It’s that very research that will be the focus of the Packard Fellowship’s funds. Taboada says the discretionary nature of the funds gives him the flexibility to hire personnel to contribute to a range of projects, including investigating the biophysics of the proteins responsible for the vibrant colors in frogs, identifying non-visual novel photoreceptors and exploring the remarkable mechanisms that allow glassfrogs to thrive in hypoxic conditions. Taboada also will purchase components to build specialized equipment and cameras to enhance his lab and field work.

When he’s not in his lab hanging out with a kaleidoscope of colored frogs, Taboada enjoys playing guitar and taking in concerts, especially with his wife and son. Coming to Nashville has allowed him to dive headfirst into both of his passions—science and music. “I really enjoy the collaborative environment I found at Vanderbilt. Being surrounded by creative scientists and having access to state-of-the-art facilities opens avenues to pursue any research direction I might be interested in, which is a blessing,” Taboada said. “In Nashville, I’ve found a city that offers both beautiful landscapes and opportunities. The blend of music and nature is magnificent. The variety of options and vibrant cultural life are exciting, and we are thoroughly enjoying all those opportunities.”","Meet Vanderbilt’s first Packard Fellow Carlos Taboada, assistant professor of biological sciences and frog whisperer","For Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences Carlos Taboada, the fascination with wildlife and biology began when he was a kid.
